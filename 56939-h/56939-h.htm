<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Tin can toys were invented after a fruitless
search of the toy shops for a large tin locomotive. I
had a long can in my shop at home that I thought
could be very easily worked up into a toy locomotive
boiler by adding a few fittings, such as a piece of tin
rolled up into the form of a smokestack. Part of a
small can could be used for a steam dome, or I could
use the top part of a certain tooth-powder can, the
distributor top of which would look very much like a
whistle. A cocoa tin came in very handy for a cab,
and a thumb-tack box served for a headlight. The
wheels were made of can lids soldered together, and
the toy locomotive was made, much to the joy of my
very young son, who has had it in constant service
for over a year, and it is still good for many trips at
the end of a string.</p>

<p>I had always used tin cans for making such articles
as water motors, glue pots, melting ladles,
mooring buoys for model yachts, etc., but the locomotive
was the first toy, made wholly from tin cans,
that I had produced, and this suggested other toys.
The steam roller was next made.</p>

<p>I found that the cans lend themselves very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to the making of toys, so much of the work being
already done.</p>

<p>The materials used to make these toys are plentiful
and inexpensive—cans are everywhere. The
tools needed are few and easy to use, and I found
that so many different and amusing durable toys
could be made from used tin cans, and also that
everyone seemed to have such fun making the toys,
that I decided to use them for teaching purposes.</p>

<p>Tin can toy making has been thoroughly tried
out in a grade school under a very able teacher, who
understands making them. Pupils of ten, eleven and
twelve years of age have proved that these toys are
easy to make, and many schools now have the work
well established.</p>

<p>The steam roller, shown in <a href="#plate11">Plate XI</a>, was made
by a boy of ten after a model which I made for it.
This same boy developed quite a trade of his own by
soldering up various pieces of tinware for his mother
and the neighbors.</p>

<p>But, better still, working with the tin cans has
developed the inventive faculties of my class to a
surprising degree. The pupils have thought out and
made many models of their own—not only toys but
useful things as well. Various members of the class
investigated the large trucks, automobiles, hoisting
engines, locomotives, boats and such things seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
any water-front community, to see how they were
made and how they worked, and why. These pupils
then returned to the school shops and made models
of their own, many of which showed considerable
invention and ingenuity.</p>

<p>I decided to teach the Occupational Aides in my
classes at Columbia University how to make these
toys, so that they in turn could teach the wounded
soldiers in the hospitals.</p>

<p>It is a great pleasure to know that as this book
goes to press many a wounded soldier has been and
is still being amused and benefited by making the
tin can toys here.</p>

<p>But the making of tin can toys is by no means
limited to hospitals and schools. Any one who cares
to tinker, to handle tools, to use up waste materials,
may find pleasure and profit from assembling tin
cans and parts of them. Many useful and attractive
things may be made for the home, shop, or camp.</p>

<p>I have found it quite possible to make many
decorative things from tin cans, and for some years
I have made lanterns, candlesticks, sconces and trays
of all kinds. The shape of the cans themselves lends
them to decoration when assembled by a person having
a sense of design and proportion.</p>

<p>There is nothing weak or flimsy about a well-made
tin can toy. A strip of flat tin is very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bent; if that same strip of tin is bent at right angles
through its whole length, like the angle iron encountered
in structural iron work, it will be found to be
remarkably stiff.</p>

<p>Bend up an angle on each side of a strip of tin,
like a channel iron used in buildings; it will sustain
a remarkable load.</p>

<p>I have used the common forms employed in
structural steel for building up the toys shown in
this book with the result that they are surprisingly
solid and durable, though made entirely from cans or
the tin taken from flattened-out cans and boxes.</p>

<p>No rough or sharp edges are left about these
toys. The edges of a piece of tin may be folded
over or “hemmed”—or a folded strip of tin may
be slipped over an edge that needs strengthening.
Thus all danger of cutting the fingers or of thin
edges being bent out of shape is done away with.</p>

<p>Although made of tin, there need be nothing
“tinny” about a well-made, well-painted tin can toy.</p>

<p>Very few and very simple tools are required for
the work and the solder, soldering flux, rivets, wire
and paint are very inexpensive items, as so little
need be used for each piece produced.</p>

<p>Soldering is by far the most important of the
operations involved in tin can toy making. But
it is very simple, once it is understood. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
principles that govern the process of soldering are
thoroughly mastered there is no difficulty at all about
it. Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a> should be thoroughly read
and re-read before trying to solder, and at least two
practice pieces well soldered together before going
any further.</p>

<p>Since the tin can toys were introduced into my
classes at college I have taught more than two hundred
pupils how to make them. Many of these pupils
had little or no experience with tools and had never
expected to have any until the war came along and
changed the ideas of many people as to their ability
to work with their hands. I have yet to encounter
a pupil who could not solder after a very short
period of instruction.</p>

<p>Look at the end of a small olive oil can or the
end of a tin commonly used to contain cocoa, then
think of the shape of the radiator and hood of the
modern automobile. The shape of the can and the
shape of the hood of the automobile are very much
alike. A few holes punched in the end of the can in
regular rows transform it into a miniature radiator
in appearance, and some slits cut in the side of the
can look very much like the vents in the side of a real
auto hood. Solder the cap of a tooth-paste or paint
tube in place over the radiator, and the hood and
radiator are completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>To have formed up a hood of this sort from a
plain sheet of metal would have taken far more skill
than the average tinker is likely to possess, but you
have it ready made in the can, and this is the whole
idea of tin can toy building.</p>

<p>Less than half of a rectangular two-quart can
used for a certain cooking oil makes up into a truck
body so like the bodies on the real trucks that it
would be difficult to find or make one more like them.</p>

<p>Many different kinds of boats that will really
float may be made from mackerel and herring tins
which are usually made in the shape of boats. Two
mackerel tins soldered together suggest the fighting
tank. Only a little work is necessary to transform
these cans into real toys.</p>

<p>Long cylindrical cans suggest boilers for toy
locomotives, hoisting and traction engines, steam
rollers and the like.</p>

<p>Wheels for rolling stock may be made from cans
or the can lids. Small adhesive tape boxes make
excellent headlights or searchlights and also pilot
houses for tiny tug boats. Bottle caps, thumb-tack
boxes, and the small screw tops of olive or cooking
oil cans suggest head, side and tail lights for toy
automobiles, and many other things.</p>

<p>Aside from the pleasure derived from the actual
making of tin can toys, perhaps the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
satisfaction lies in the fact that you are using material
usually thrown away—making something out
of nothing.</p>

<p>And so this book is offered to tinkers by a tinker
with the hope that they may get some of the pleasure
out of it that he has had in writing it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>RECONSTRUCTION AIDE, DIRECTOR OF THE RED
CROSS WORK SHOP FOR PATIENTS AT NEUROLOGICAL
BASE HOSPITAL 117, LA FAUCHE, HAUTE MARNE, FRANCE</p>

</div>

<p>“The hospital was new and its needs were many.
We began work the day after our arrival and by the
time our small equipment was unpacked (Mrs.
Myers refers here to her own personal equipment
of tools which was necessarily a small one as it was
brought from America. The hospital shops were
not equipped with tools until after the Aides had
established the work and decided on the necessary
tools needed), requests were coming in from all
quarters of the hospital for us to make everything
from tables and dishes to doughnut cutters. There
was such a lack of material that the problem of making
them could have been solved by nothing less than
ingenuity of the American soldier and the ever present
tin can pile.</p>

<p>“Some old French hospital beds found on the
salvage heap were quickly converted into work
benches. It was then that the tin can ceased to be a
thing to be burned and buried and came into its own.</p>

<p>“Our first need was a charcoal furnace to heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
our soldering coppers. This was made from two
large square tins with an interlining of brick. A
bit of an old grate completed this perfectly good
furnace which served us well for many months.</p>

<p>“The wants of the kitchen were next considered.
For washing dishes we made three huge wooden
tubs 2 by 2½ by 6 feet. The lining and drain
pipes for these were made from several large tin
cans. As the size of the hospital increased there was
a constant demand for such things as biscuit pans,
doughnut cutters, funnels, potato graters, vegetable
strainers, soap dishes and other small necessities.</p>

<p>“For the officers’ wards, barracks, and recreation
hut, we made tin candlesticks, flower holders,
ash trays, electric light shades, tea trays, desk sets,
and filing boxes. All of which were not only useful
but quite ornamental, as they were attractively
painted and decorated by the patients. The soldiers
took great interest in the making of mechanical
toys, especially war-like ones, such as tanks, aeroplanes,
cannon and army trucks.</p>

<p>“The reflectors for the foot lights of the stage
in the Red Cross Recreation Hut were made of tin
cans. The end-men in the minstrel show were quite
gay in tin can hats—what could have been more
simple—a tin brim with an inverted butter can for
a crown, gaudily painted and beribboned!</p>

<p>“The princess in the Christmas play was in need
of shining armor. Half circles of tin overlapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
each other not only served the purpose but were
glitteringly gorgeous. The Three Kings in the play
were badly in need of crowns; three oatmeal tins
were beautifully fashioned into kingly headdresses
for them.</p>

<p>“The Christmas tree was brilliant with hundreds
of stars, diamonds, and crescents, and candle
holders, which was the final contribution of our
much sought and never failing friend, the tin can
pile, as the hospital was evacuated soon afterwards.</p>

<p>“I have had entire charge of the work and have
taught the other Aides the tin can work, as it was a
most necessary thing for them to know. Many of
these Aides were sent to other hospital workshops
and introduced the work there.”</p>

<p>VARIOUS KINDS OF CANS AND BOXES—PREPARING
CANS FOR THE WORK—CUTTING IN AND OPENING
OUT CANS AND BOXES</p>

</div>

<p>There are many shapes and sizes of tin cans
and boxes as every one knows; round, square, elliptical,
tall, short, or flat. A surprising number of
attractive shapes and sizes may be collected in a
short time in any community. Housewives are only
too glad to find some one to use them.</p>

<p>Cans that are well rinsed with hot water as soon
as the contents are removed are not at all objectionable
to work with; but cans that have not been
rinsed out, or that have been thrown out and exposed
to the weather are very unpleasant objects, and besides,
a rusty can is very difficult to solder. It is a
simple matter to rinse or scald out a can as soon as
the contents are removed.</p>

<p>Tomato, corn, pea and condensed milk cans are
the most plentiful. Coffee, tea, cocoa, jam, mackerel
and sardine cans, olive and cooking oil cans, baking
powder and spice cans are all useful for making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
things described in this book and for many more
besides. Biscuit boxes, tobacco boxes, cold cream,
ointment, and the small adhesive tape boxes all contain
possibilities. The screw tops of olive oil and
cooking oil cans, and bottle caps should be collected
for this work. Jelly glass lids, in fact, all shallow
tin lids are useful. Syrup and molasses cans with
separate lids, that push into place are worth saving,
especially the lids. Certain containers of dry material
are now largely made of pasteboard with tin
tops, lids and bottoms. The tin parts of these containers
are often of an attractive shape. The large
round gallon cans used by hotels and restaurants are
particularly useful, and a sizable piece of tin may
be obtained from the sides of the can and the bottoms
may be used for large candlestick saucers and many
other things. Large square tin boxes used to contain
100 pounds of cocoa may be obtained from some
restaurants. These are made of heavy tin and five
large sheets may be cut from the bottom and sides.
Considerably over $1 would have to be paid for the
same amount of tin.</p>

<p><b>Preparing Cans for the Work.</b>—Cans that have
contained paint, stove-blacking, heavy oils or
greases, or cans that have been standing about with
part of the contents exposed to the air may be thoroughly
cleaned of all foreign matter by the hot lye
bath. This bath is made up by adding two heaping
tablespoonfuls of lye or washing soda to the gallon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of boiling water. Cans boiled up in this solution
for a few minutes will be cleaned of all paint, paper
labels, etc. Keep the hands out of the solution and
do not allow any of it to come in contact with the
clothes. Lift the work out of it with a wire hook
and rinse off the lye with hot water; stand the cans
bottom up so that they will drain out without any
water remaining in them. The lye solution may be
used for a number of times and then may be poured
down the sink, as lye is an excellent thing for drain
pipes. Do not leave a lye bath in the shop without
covering it tightly when not in use, as the fumes
from it are sure to rust every tool in the place.</p>

<p>Coffee, tea, cocoa, talcum and other cans that
have contained dry material need not be put in the
lye bath until ready to paint, unless the labels are
too much in the way for soldering. Small boxes
such as contain tobacco are almost covered with a
sort of varnished paint. This may be scraped away
where the box is to be soldered, but if much soldering
is to be done the whole box should be boiled up in
the lye bath until all the paint is removed. Sometimes
the lye softens the paint but does not entirely
remove it. More lye may be added to the bath and
the work left in it awhile longer, or the work may
be removed from the bath and the softened paint
scrubbed away with a scrubbing brush and plenty
of clean water. After being used several times, the
bath will become too muddy and weak for further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
use and then a fresh one should be made, as the lye
is inexpensive.</p>

<p>For good work, it is necessary that the cans be
thoroughly clean.</p>

<p><b>Cutting Into and Opening Out Cans and Boxes.</b>—There
is one very easy way to cut into and open
out a can or box. To make wheels, small trays and
other things, a good part of the sides of the can must
be cut away leaving a small portion of the sides
attached to the bottom. The part that is cut away
may be flattened out and used to make various
things. As most of the cans used are cut down to
various dimensions in this manner, either to use the
bottom with part of the sides, or to obtain flat sheets
of tin, it will be well to consider the easiest way
of doing it.</p>

<p>First, determine how much of the bottom portion
of the can is to be left intact. Then using a pair of
dividers opened to this dimension, make a line
parallel with the base of the can and completely
around it. To do this, hold the can down to the
bench with the left hand so that it may be turned
against the divider points as shown in <a href="#plate4">Plate IV, <i>a</i>.</a>
Hold the dividers firmly down to the bench and
against the can so that the uppermost point is held
at exactly the same height from the bench during
the turning or marking, while turning the can against
the point to mark it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Then using a pair of straight metal shears, cut
down each side of the seam or joint in the side of the
can to within one-half inch of the horizontal line
you have marked with the dividers (see <a href="#plate4">Plate IV, <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<p>Bend out the narrow strip containing the seam
and cut it off with the shears. This will give you
an open slot in the side of the can in which
the shears may be easily introduced to cut horizontally
around it.</p>

<p>Do not try to cut directly on the line marked
around the can with the dividers but begin cutting
about half an inch above this line and cut completely
around the can until you have cut off the
whole top part of it. After you have cut away the
larger portion of the metal, the narrow strip remaining
above the line may be easily cut away as it
curls up out of the way as it is cut by the shears.</p>

<p>The can should be held in the left hand with the
open end or top toward you (see <a href="#plate4">Plate IV, <i>c</i></a>). Be
sure you hold the can in this manner. With the tin
snips held in the right hand, start cutting toward
the left hand always when cutting around a can or
box. Bend the tin out of the way as you cut. You
will find that it is impossible to cut in a straight line
or to make a continuous unbroken cut while cutting
away a large portion of the can. But, after the
larger piece is out of the way, the narrow strip
remaining above the line may be easily cut away if
you cut toward your left hand and hold the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
end of the can toward you. It is impossible to cut a
straight line around a cylindrical form with a pair
of straight shears unless the shears cut from right
to left and that part of the metal which is cut away
is nearest the operator.</p>

<p>The beginner will perhaps find it easier to handle
the cans if a pair of old thin kid gloves are worn.</p>

<p>If one can afford it, the pair of double cutting
shears such as are listed in the supplementary tools
on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a> are excellent things to have for opening
and cutting around cans. These shears have three
blades, and one blade cutting between two fixed
blades cuts away a narrow strip of tin as the shears
are worked along in such a manner that a straight
line may be followed around a can at the first cutting.
The point of the single blade may be punched
into the side of a can and the cut started around
the can at any point. If many cans are to be cut
down, these double cutting shears will save much
time and trouble. However, the straight shears will
answer well enough, if the above directions are carefully
followed.</p>

<p>Be sure to try not to cut to the line the first time
you cut around a can. Cut away the larger part first
and then cut to the line when there is only a narrow
strip to cut away. Do not mind if the first piece cut
away looks very rough and jagged. It may be a
little difficult at first, but patience and practice will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
soon make it quite easy to cut open a can in this
manner, using a pair of ordinary straight shears.</p>

<p>Cut away the top of the can or the rolled edge
adhering to that part of the can which is cut away;
trim away all jagged edges; place flat on the bench
or anvil and flatten out the tin with light blows of a
wooden mallet. Lay this tin aside until needed.</p>

<p>I find it convenient to cut away the top or rolled
edge of large round cans before cutting around
them near the bottom, as then it is easy to bend the
comparatively large sheet of tin out of the way of
the shears as I cut around the can at the bottom. A
large pair of shears is very convenient for opening
large cans, but small ones will do if intelligently used.</p>

<p>When cutting metal with a pair of shears, always
remember that the shears cut more powerfully near
the joint or bolt, particularly when cutting through
a folded seam or soldered joint. Keep the shears
well oiled and have them sharpened by a competent
mechanic when they become dull.</p>

<p>When cutting narrow strips of tin, be careful
not to get the tin jammed between the shear blades
so that the blades are forced apart sideways.
Keep the bolt tightened so that the blades fit
closely together.</p>

<p>One might suppose that cut or burned fingers
would be plentiful in a large class of tin toy makers,
but such has not proved to be the case. There have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
been surprisingly few accidents of this sort and
none of them at all serious.</p>

<p>One soon learns how to handle tin so as to avoid
rough or sharp edges and that a soldering copper is
provided with an ample handle so that it may be
safely and easily handled when hot.</p>

<p>Some of the students found that old kid gloves
with parts of the fingers cut off afforded protection
to hands that were not used to shop work.</p>

<p>A bottle of iodine was kept handy and such
slight cuts that were encountered were immediately
washed with cold water and iodine applied to the
cut which was then lightly bandaged. This treatment
proved most effective and no ill effects resulted.</p>

<p>A mixture of pure linseed oil and lime water
may be obtained at any druggists and this is a very
effective remedy for burns. The solution should be
well shaken up and applied directly to the burn
which should then be bandaged with bandages wet
with the mixture.</p>

<p>Common brown laundry soap worked up into a
thick lather is an excellent remedy for slight burns.</p>

<p>Care and patience used in handling the tin and
the tools will leave very little use for the above
remedies in the shop.</p>

<p>The various problems presented in this book of
tin can toys should be worked out in the order in
which they are presented as each one bears a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
relation to the others. Be sure to work out the
simpler problems first—even if you have had considerable
experience in other forms of metal working.
A number of processes particularly adapted to
working tin are used in making tin can toys.</p>

<p>While these processes are very simple, they are
somewhat unlike those involved in copper working
and jewelry making, though more closely allied to
the commercial metal work of to-day.</p>

<p>TOOL LISTS AND COSTS—LAYING OUT AND MARKING
OFF THE WORK—SHOP APPLIANCES</p>

</div>

<p>In this chapter the names and approximate costs
of the tools and appliances are given and also suggestions
as to fitting up the shop for working with
the cans. Various methods are suggested for laying
out the work with the ruler, square and dividers.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that tool prices are not
fixed and that the prices quoted in the following
lists are the market prices of to-day, July 29, 1918.
At present, tools are much higher in price than usual
owing to conditions brought about by the war. Tool
prices vary with market conditions.</p>

<p>The tools listed may be bought at any good hardware
store or ordered from the catalogues of any of
the large mail order houses (except the Wooden
Roofing Folder and the Forming Mallet). While
the folder is not absolutely necessary for folding up
angles in the tin, it is much better to have one to
make the numerous angles employed in tin work
than to attempt folding by hand, and particularly
when long angles are to be made for lanterns, towers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
automobile chassis and the like. In fact, it is in
almost constant use.</p>

<p>The wooden roofing folder is not carried in
stock by hardware and mail order houses, but it may
be ordered from a dealer in tin-smiths’ or sheet
metal workers’ tools. Any good tinner or plumber
will tell you where to order one.</p>

<p>The forming mallet is easily made from a block
of maple or a piece of broom handle as described
under Shop Appliances.</p>

<p>It is taken for granted that such simple tools as
rulers and pencils are at hand.</p>

<p><b>Materials Needed Aside from the Cans.</b>—Galvanized
wire, 10 or 15 feet each of the following
diameters: ⅟₁₆, ⅛, ³⁄₁₆, ¼ (if impossible to obtain
all these diameters, get ⅛ inch or larger). Wire
nails, about ½ lb. each of the following sizes: 2d,
3d, 4d, 6d, 8d, 10d, 20d (d is the abbreviation for
penny). Tinned rivets, several dozen of the smallest
size (a box containing one gross is about as cheap
as six dozen). Can of lye or 2 pounds of washing
soda. For heating the soldering copper, a heater of
some kind, such as a blue flame kerosene stove, gas
furnace or common one-burner gas stove, charcoal
furnace, or gasoline plumbers’ torch with attachments
for holding copper. A large can or pail, or
an old wash boiler for holding the hot lye solution.</p>

<p><b>Supplementary Tool List.</b>—The tools named in
this list will be found very convenient for making
the more advanced models, particularly the hand
drill and the twist drills which are used with the
hand drill. The supplementary tools are by no
means necessary for making the tin can toys, but if
one can afford to get them, they will be found extremely
convenient. However, almost any of the
models may be made with the tools listed on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>,
if one is sufficiently skillful in the use of them. The
more work one does with tools the fewer tools one
needs if the tools are intelligently used.</p>

<p>The tools in both lists should be purchased, if
possible, as they are all tools commonly used in metal
working shops. Purchase the tools listed on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
first and go as far as possible with them, and then
purchase as many of the supplementary tools as
possible when you need them.</p>

<p>Except when noted otherwise, these tools may
be purchased at any good hardware store.</p>

<p><b>Laying Out and Marking Off the Work.</b>—Before
attempting to begin actual work with the cans, it
may be well to consider various ways of measuring
to certain dimensions and transferring these measurements
to the surface of the tin, and laying out
and marking off the work for cutting, folding, etc.</p>

<p>The tools needed for this work are few and
simple. A ruler, a marking awl, a small try square,
and a pair of spring dividers are all one needs for
this part of the work. The ruler may be of wood
or metal and should be at least 12 inches in length
with the inch divisions marked on it. A plain
straight rule of hard wood such as is used in the
grade schools will do very well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="plate6">

<p class="caption">PLATE VI</p>

<img src="images/plate6.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">The tools needed for tin can toy making</p>

</div>

<p>The marking awl may be purchased at any good
tool house or hardware store or an ice pick will do
very well if sharpened to a good point so that a line
may be easily scratched in the surface of the tin with
the point. A large stiff needle may be forced in a
pen handle to make an excellent marking awl or a
common steel knitting needle may be used if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
point is sufficiently sharp. Metal workers always
scratch their dimension lines in the surface of the
metal as pencil lines are easily rubbed away by the
hands when working with the metal.</p>

<p>The try square should be about six inches long
at the blade or measuring side, and should be entirely
constructed of metal and the measuring blade should
be marked off in inches and fractions thereof. Good
try squares may frequently be purchased in the 5
and 10 cent stores and these are quite accurate
enough for the purpose. The spring dividers should
be about 6 inches in length. These dividers are held
open by the strong spring in the top and are opened
and closed by a nut acting on the screw thread. Do
not purchase the heavy dividers or compass commonly
used by carpenters as these are not as capable
of the small adjustments as are the spring dividers.
The spring dividers may sometimes be found at the
5 and 10 cent stores and may always be found at
good hardware stores and tool houses.</p>

<p>All the tools used for laying out and marking off
the work are plainly shown (<a href="#plate6">Plate VI</a>).</p>

<p><b>Laying Out Work.</b>—It should be borne in mind
that a little time spent in carefully measuring, laying
out and marking off the work will make a great difference
in the finished appearance of that work, so
that these simple operations should not be slighted.</p>

<p>The steel square should always be used in laying
out rectangular work: lines that are supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at right angles or “square.” Work that is not carefully
laid out or square will not fit together neatly
if it fits at all.</p>

<p>One of the first things that one has to do in the
tin can work is to trim up a piece of tin that is taken
from the side of a can and flattened out.</p>

<p>Suppose that such a piece of tin has been cut
from a can and flattened out, the edges of such a
piece of tin are rather jagged and the whole piece
should be trimmed off square before trying to use
the tin for various purposes.</p>

<p>First place the ruler as near to the upper edge of
the tin as possible and so as not to include any of
the jagged cuts. Hold the ruler down firmly and
draw the point of the marking awl along the edge
of the ruler until a straight line is scratched along
the edge of the tin. The surplus tin above this line
should be cut away with the metal shears by cutting
along from right to left so that the narrow and
jagged strip of tin is curled up out of the way by
the shears as it is cut. When the surplus tin is cut
away you should have a straight clean edge at which
to begin the marking operations.</p>

<p><b>Using the Try Square.</b>—Next, the two ends of
the piece of tin should be squared off using the try
square for squaring up the ends as follows: Place
the heavy solid part of the square firmly against the
freshly cut straight edge of the tin, near one end in
such a manner that the blade of the square with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
inch divisions marked on it lays squarely across the
tin, and as near as possible to the end of the piece
but not including any of the jagged cuts. The position
of the square is shown in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;" id="fig1">
<img src="images/figure1.jpg" width="200" height="170" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 280px;" id="fig2">
<img src="images/figure2.jpg" width="280" height="170" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>When the square is in position, mark a line across
the tin with the scratch awl held closely to the blade.
Cut away the extra tin and you have two sides of
your piece of tin squared. Proceed in the same
manner to trim off the other end. The remaining
or long side of the piece may be squared up either by
using the ruler or the spring dividers. The strip of
tin that you have squared up on three sides will
probably be narrower at one end than at the other.
Measure the width of the narrow end with the ruler
and then measure off this same distance at the opposite
end and mark it with the scratch awl. Use the
ruler to connect the two measuring points and
scratch a line in the tin by drawing the scratch awl
along the edge of the ruler. Cut away the surplus
tin and your piece of tin should be squared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The spring dividers may be opened so that the
points rest exactly on each corner of the narrowest
end of the strips of tin. Then the dividers are
moved to the opposite end of the strip and the
lower end or point of the dividers moved back and
forth slightly until a slight scratch is made in the
surface of the tin to indicate the measuring point.
The position of the dividers is shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>. The
ruler is used to connect the two measuring points
and a line scratched between them.</p>

<p>Small strips of tin may be marked off entirely by
the dividers by setting the dividers to the required
dimension, placing the dividers so that one point
rests against one edge of the strip to be marked off
and then drawing the dividers along in such a manner
that the point of the dividers that rests on the
tin will scratch a line parallel to the edge. The edge
of the tin that the point of the dividers rests against
must, of course, be cut straight before beginning the
marking operations. The strip thus marked off may
be cut away and another one marked off in the same
manner until the required number of strips is cut.</p>

<p>Suppose that four strips are to be cut, each strip
to measure one by ten inches. Square up a piece of
tin to measure four by ten inches. Open the dividers
so that the points are exactly one inch apart. Rest
one point of the dividers against one edge of the
tin as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> and draw it along the entire
length of the tin so as to scratch a line parallel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the edge. Cut off this strip, taking care to make a
straight cut and then mark off another strip and cut
it off, and so on until all four strips are cut. This
method of using the dividers for marking is more
accurate and much easier than that of using a ruler
to measure off each strip, and certainly more rapid.</p>

<p><b>Finding Wheel Centers with the Dividers.</b>—When
making wheels of tin cans, some easy method
must be used to find the center of the wheel in order
to punch or bore a hole for the axle so that the axle
may be placed as near the center of the wheel as
possible, and so that the wheel will run true once it
is placed on the axle.</p>

<p>The dividers may be used for this operation
which is very simple. The can is first made up into
wheel form as described in <a href="#Page_108">Chapter X, page 108</a>.
When the wheel is soldered together lay it flat on
the bench. Open the dividers so that one point
rests against the rim of the wheel or against the
rolled edge of the can forming the rim of the wheel.
If the wheel is made of a can that has a cap soldered
on each end and this cap forms the end of the can
(such as the small cans that are used for evaporated
milk), then the one leg of the dividers may be rested
in the slight line or depression just inside the rim
that is invariably found in this can. Open the
dividers so that the other point rests as near the
center as you can guess it. When the dividers are
set to dimension and are in position on the wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
as shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, then move the point of the
dividers that is near the center of the wheel slightly
back and forth so that it describes a slight arc and
scratches it in the surface of the can and the other
point of the divider is held
at the point near the rim of
the wheel during this operation.
Then move the dividers
directly across the wheel still
set at the same dimension,
placing one point against the
rim or in the depressed line
and describing a slight arc
in the tin as before. Set the
dividers at right angles to
the first two marking points
having the dividers still
opened to the same dimension
as at first and
describe another arc. Set
the dividers directly across
from this point and describe
another arc. The wheel should then resemble <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>,
the four arcs forming sort of a pillow shape as
shown. Draw lines diametrically across connecting
each corner of the pillow as shown and where these
lines cross is the center of the wheel.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;" id="fig3">
<img src="images/figure3.jpg" width="150" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If one is so fortunate as to possess a tool called
a surface gauge, it will be found very handy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
marking or scribing lines parallel to the base of cans.
This tool consists of a base of metal in which is
fixed an upright post also of metal. An adjustable
scriber or needle is fixed to this post so that it may
be lowered or raised and set in position as desired.
The point is adjusted to the required height and
placed against the side of
the can or surface to be
marked, the operation being
conducted on a flat level
surface. The can is simply
turned against the fixed
scriber point until it is
entirely marked around.
The advantage of the surface
gauge over the dividers
for this operation is
that the scriber point is held rigidly at a fixed dimension
above the base of the can while the dividers
must be held firmly in place by the hand. However,
the dividers will do very well for this operation after
a little practice.</p>

<h3>SHOP APPLIANCES</h3>

<p><b>Homemade Substitutes for Expensive Tools.</b>—The
tool of first importance in any metal working
shop is a good vise. There is no substitute for this
tool and a good one that measures three or three and
a half inches across the jaws should be purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
from a reliable tool dealer. The next tool of importance
is some form of anvil or anvils for flattening
or rounding the tin. A small bench anvil may
be purchased from the tool dealer. These are much
like a blacksmith’s anvil with a flat face and a conical
horn and are made of iron and steel. The large
mail order houses offer various small anvils of cast
iron for farm use and these are excellent for the
tin shop.</p>

<p>Excellent substitutes for these anvils are easily
made from old flat irons and pieces of gas or water
pipe. Short lengths of iron and steel bars may be
picked up about any junk pile, and these are very
useful to form the tin over.</p>

<p><i>The Flat Iron Anvil.</i>—An old flat iron, the kind
with the handle attached, may be found about almost
any household. The handle should be broken off as
close to the top of the iron as possible. Use a hammer
and cold chisel for this and cut the handle ends
deeply all around where they join the iron. When
they are deeply nicked, several sharp blows from a
large hammer should break the handle away.</p>

<p>File away all roughness until the iron will set
level with the smooth or ironing face uppermost.
Then you have an excellent flat hard surface for
straightening out tin or wire.</p>

<p><i>Pipe and Bar Anvils.</i>—Short lengths of iron
pipe, round and square iron and steel bars of various
diameters may be held in the vise jaws and used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
form the work over. Large wire nails may also be
used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The smaller sizes, such as ¼, ⅜, or ½ inch in
diameter, should be solid iron or steel bars 8 or 10
inches in length, as small pipe crushes and bends
rather easily in the vise. Larger sizes, such as ¾,
½, 1 or 2 inches in diameter, are better made of pipe
as they are lighter and easier to handle and also
easier to obtain.</p>

<p>Get all the sizes suggested if possible and as
many short pieces of square or flat bars as you find
convenient to store away about the shop. They
will come in very usefully for bending or forming
operations. The method of holding them in the vise
is plainly shown on <a href="#fig26">page 89, Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<p>If you have plenty of bench room and are handy
with tools, several of the most used sizes of pipe
and bars may be clamped or bolted directly to the
bench with wooden or metal holding strips. The
larger sizes, such as ¾, 1, 1½, 2 and 3 inches in
diameter, will be found very convenient if fastened
to the bench in this manner.</p>

<p><i>The Bench.</i>—The shop bench should be about
31 inches in height. The top of the bench should be
about 2½ by 6 feet or larger if possible, and may
easily be built by any one familiar with tools. The
top should be made of maple about 1½ inches thick.
If one cannot afford this bench a common kitchen
table makes an excellent substitute. A good strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
table of this sort may be purchased at any house-furnishing
store. These tables are furnished with a
large drawer in which small tools may be kept.</p>

<p>If much of the tin work is done, it will prove
advantageous to have some light wooden shelves or
racks built about the walls of the shop to store the
various sized cans where they may be easily seen
and reached.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Forming Mallet.</i>—The special forming
mallet designed by the author will have to be made.
It was designed especially for work with the tin
cans. It is very simple and easily made of maple by
any carpenter. One end is a slightly rounded dome
shape and the other is in the form of a blunt wedge.
The dimensions and general shape of the mallet are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
shown in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>. The handle may be made of a
piece of ½-inch dowel rod. A substitute for this
mallet may be made of a piece of broom handle the
end of which is already rounded to about the proper
curve. Measure off 4½ inches from the rounded
end of the broom handle and saw it off. Bore a
½-inch hole through the center of the piece to fit
the piece of dowel rod used for the handle. Whittle
down the end to a blunt wedge shape leaving it
about ⅜ inch thick at the end. The rounded end
may be left as it is.</p>

<p>A piece of ½-inch maple dowel may be picked
up in any carpenter shop. This should be 8½ inches
long. It should be driven into the hole drilled for
it in the mallet, taking care not to split the mallet
in so doing. If the broom handle is rather small in
diameter it would probably be better to use a piece
of ⁷⁄₁₆-or ⅜-inch dowel for the handle. A small
nail or brad may be driven through the mallet and
handle to secure it in place.</p>

<p>CUTTING THE CAN TO SIZE FOR BISCUIT CUTTER—PUNCHING
A HOLE IN TIN—FORMING THE
HANDLE—FOLDING—MAKING A SUGAR SCOOP
BY THE SAME METHOD</p>

</div>

<p>A biscuit cutter is about the simplest thing
that may be made from a tin can. It is an excellent
thing to begin with as it is so simple and involves
three very essential operations in the tin can work:
cutting the can to size, forming the handle, and
lastly, soldering (see <a href="#plate7">Plate VII, <i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p>Select a good bright, clean can about 2½ inches
in diameter; a baking powder can or a small soup
can will do.</p>

<p>Tin cans are usually made up in two ways. One
method is to solder on flanged ends, such as condensed
or evaporated milk cans, and the other method
is to roll the edges of the can together at each end,
using no solder. When looked at closely, the two
different types of can are easily told apart. A rolled
rim can should be used for the biscuit cutter as it is
stronger than the can with the soldered ends.</p>

<p class="caption">Soldering</p>

</div>

<p><b>Cutting the Can to Size for Biscuit Cutter.</b>—The
biscuit cutter should be about ¾ inch deep at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
cutting edge. Set the dividers to this dimension and
proceed to scribe a line around the can parallel to the
base and ¾ inch above the rolled rim of the bottom.
This simple scribing operation is described in
<a href="#Page_22">Chapter I, page 22</a>.</p>

<p>The method of cutting into the can and around
the scribed line is very simple and is also described
in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="fig6">
<img src="images/figure6.jpg" width="250" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When you have cut the can down to the required
dimension, it should
appear as shown in
<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. The biscuit
cutter may be slightly
out of shape after the
cutting operation, but
this may be easily remedied
by placing the
biscuit cutter on a
small round anvil
held in the vise and by tapping it gently with a flat
wooden mallet, turning the cutter slowly around on
the anvil during the hammering as shown in <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>.
Be sure to turn the biscuit cutter slowly around and
around the anvil as it is hammered with the mallet.
It will soon become round if hammered gently.</p>

<p>Next take a small flat file, one with very fine
teeth, usually called a smooth milled file, and with
this smooth down any roughness left by the metal
shears at the edge of the biscuit cutter. The method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of using the file is shown in <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>. It should be
held lightly against the work when filing. (Never
try to file a piece of tin with a large or roughly
toothed file as the coarse teeth will catch on the tin
and tear or bend it out of shape.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 250px;" id="fig7">
<img src="images/figure7.jpg" width="250" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p>

<img src="images/figure8.jpg" width="150" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Do not try to file the edge of the cutter to a
knife fine edge; simply file away the metal raised by
the shears when cutting. If it is cleanly cut and
filed to the original thickness of the tin, it will cut
biscuit dough very well, as the tin is thin.</p>

<p><b>Punching a Hole in Tin.</b>—A hole should be
punched in the top of the biscuit cutter to admit air,
as the biscuit dough is apt to stick in the cutter by
the vacuum formed unless an air vent is provided.
A small hole about ⅛ inch in diameter will do, but
a series of such holes may be punched in if desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>A punch may be filed up from a wire nail or a
regular punch or nail set may be used.</p>

<p>The biscuit cutter is placed over the end of a
block of wood held in a vise as shown in <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>, in
such a manner that the top of the cutter rests
directly on the wood. The punch is placed in the
center of the cutter, care being taken to see that
the wooden block supports the tin directly under the
punch, and then the punch is struck lightly with the
hammer until it cuts through the tin.</p>

<p>It may be well to try the punch on a scrap of tin
to test it. A clean round hole should result. The
punch cuts out a tiny disk of tin and drives it into
the wood. The end grain of a wooden block should
always be used for punching on.</p>

<p>If a nail is used for a punch, the original point
should be filed away. Nail points are usually made
in the form of a square pyramid and if these points
are driven into a piece of tin a jagged hole will
result; such a hole may be used for making a grater
for the kitchen, but all other holes should be round
and smooth.</p>

<p>To file up a nail for a punch proceed as follows:
Place the nail vertically in the vise jaws so that the
point projects slightly above the jaws. File the
point entirely away until you are filing the entire
diameter of the nail and squarely across it.</p>

<p>Then reduce the diameter of the nail at the end
you have been filing by filing smoothly around it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>. See that the edge <i>B</i> is clean
and sharp and the nail punch is ready for use. The
nail used for a punch should always be somewhat
larger in diameter than the punching point, as this
will provide for a stronger punch and one not so
likely to bend. Regular punches are usually made
much thicker in the body than at the point, as may
be easily seen by looking at one. If desired, punches
may easily be made from nails to cut round, square,
or triangular holes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>It is much better to purchase a regular punch or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
punches for punching round holes, as these may be
purchased for 10 or 15 cents at almost any hardware
or 5-and-10 cent store. Several different sizes will
prove useful, ⅟₁₆, ⅛, ³⁄₁₆ inches in diameter being
the most used sizes. As these punches are made of
hardened steel they hold their edges for a long time,
but nails are made of a fairly soft steel and when
used as punches have to be frequently filed sharp.</p>

<p><b>Forming the Handle.</b>—After the hole is punched
in the top of the biscuit cutter, a suitable handle is
the next thing to be made. This handle may be made
from the piece of tin cut away when cutting down
the can for the biscuit cutter. Cut away any rough
or jagged edges and then place this piece of tin on
the bench or a flat anvil surface and flatten it out with
light mallet strokes. Heavy strokes with a mallet
will dent the tin.</p>

<p>Trim away all rough edges including the rolled
edge at the top and square up the piece of tin as
described on <a href="#Page_34">page 34, Chapter II</a>. Mark off a strip
of tin 1¼ inches in width and 4 inches long. Cut
this strip out and be sure that it is square at the
ends. Open the dividers and set the divider points
¼ inch apart and scribe a line ¼ inch inside each
of the long sides of the strip. The edges of the strip
of tin thus marked off must be turned or folded in
so that the edges of the handle will be strengthened
and will not cut the hand. These edges may be
folded over with a mallet or by the use of a folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
machine. The mallet should be used for this first
folding operation; the folding machine and its
use will be described further along in the book,
<a href="#Page_120">page 120, Chapter XI</a>.</p>

<p>To fold the edges over with the mallet, proceed
as follows: Secure a block of hard wood, maple
preferred, the block to be about 3 inches square and
6 inches in length. See to it that the block is cut
cleanly and squarely across so that the edges at the
end are sharp and at right angles. A maple block of
this sort may usually be picked up at any lumber
yard or carpenter shop, or a maple log may be
secured from the wood pile and trimmed up square.
One end of the block may be used to punch on.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11<i>b</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>The block is held in the vise as illustrated in
<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> and the tin to be folded is held on the block
in such a manner that the line marking the fold is
over the edge of the block. Use either a light
wooden mallet or the special forming mallet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with light blows proceed to bend down at the edge
and up to the line as illustrated in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>, <i>a</i>. Begin
at one end and work along the line to the other end
of the strip of tin. Do not try to turn the tin down
at a right angle at once or in one place and then
proceed to turn it down at another, but rather
hammer lightly along the whole length at the marking
line, turning the tin down at a slight angle from
the line to the edge and then going back and starting
to hammer where you began, turning the tin
down at a greater angle and so on until you have
turned the edge at right angles as shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>, <i>b</i>.
Always bend tin over very gently and evenly, never
forcing it violently into place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Reverse the strip of tin on the block so that the
part just folded stands vertically at the edge of the
block as shown in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>. Hammer the edge of the
tin gently over so that it folds back on itself as
shown by the dotted line in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p>Do not hammer the tin down hard at the folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
edge so that it becomes thin and sharp though
doubled. It should be rounded over so as to give
a rounded edge. A rounded fold is much stronger
than a sharp thin one. When one edge is completely
folded over, fold down the other in the same
manner, so that both edges of the handle for the
biscuit cutter appear as in <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;" id="fig15">
<img src="images/figure15.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When you have successfully turned or folded
over the edges to your satisfaction, then proceed to
give the whole handle a semi-circular form.</p>

<p>Place a large round wooden mallet or a piece of
1½ or 2-inch pipe in the vise to use as a form over
which to round the handle. The folded part should
be inside or next the mallet or pipe form shown in
<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>. Press the tin down to the form with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
palm of the hand so as to round it into shape; it may
be completely formed into shape by this method or
the rounded end of the special forming mallet may
be used to hammer it into shape if the tin should
kink during the bending. The mallet blows should
be directed toward the center of the strip so as not
to thin the edges too much.</p>

<p>Round the handle over until the ends rest inside
the rolled rim of the can or biscuit cutter and you
are ready to solder the handle in place.</p>

<p>As the soldering is the most important part of
the tin work the next two chapters are devoted to it.</p>

<p><b>The Sugar Scoop.</b>—A useful sugar or flour scoop
may be easily made from a small or large can in
exactly the same manner as the biscuit cutter, except
that the can is cut off slanting instead of square,
<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>. The edges of the scoop should not be
turned or folded but should be left as cut so as to
form a sharp cutting edge that will easily enter
sugar or flour. The handle is shaped in exactly the
same manner as that of the biscuit cutter.</p>

SOLDERING COPPERS—THE COMMON SOLDERING
COPPER—FLUXES—TINNING THE COPPER—HEATING</p>

</div>

<p><b>Soft Solder.</b>—When two or more pieces of metal
are joined together with a metallic cement, they are
said to be soldered.</p>

<p>Sheet tin, of which cans are constructed, is
always soldered with soft solder, a mixture of lead
and tin, usually 50 per cent. lead and 50 per cent. tin.</p>

<p>This solder is usually supplied in wire or bar
form at any hardware or electrical supply house.</p>

<p>Copper, brass, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and
practically any metal except aluminum may be
soldered with soft solder.</p>

<p><b>Sheet Tin.</b>—Sheet tin, so-called, really consists
of a thin sheet of iron coated on both sides with tin.
This coating of tin serves several purposes. It enables
the solder to adhere easily; it prevents the iron
from rusting; and when the sheet tin is made up
into can form, the tin coating protects the contents
of the can from chemical action on the iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Process of Soldering.</b>—Soft solder is applied
to the metal to be soldered in a molten state and this
operation requires considerable heat. When heat is
applied to metal it usually oxidizes that metal; that
is, dirties it.</p>

<p>Solder will not adhere to oxidized metal. The
metal must be protected with a coating called a flux
while being soldered. Soldering paste, soldering
fluid or “killed acid,” resin, paraffin, heavy oils,
and vaseline all serve as fluxes, some better than
others. The soldering paste is by far the best, as
will be shown later.</p>

<p>Soft solder is applied to the tin, on the point of a
hot soldering copper, often wrongly called a “soldering
iron.” A soldering copper consists of a pointed
bar of copper suitably fixed to an iron shank which
is firmly set in a wooden handle. The point of the
copper must be well coated with solder or “tinned,”
so that when it is heated it will pick up the solder
and convey it to the joint to be soldered.</p>

<p>The hot copper, charged with solder, is passed
slowly along the joint and as the tin to be soldered
receives enough heat from the copper, the solder
leaves the copper and adheres to the tin, firmly
uniting it.</p>

<p><b>Heating Apparatus.</b>—Some form of heating
apparatus is necessary to heat and maintain the
soldering copper at the melting or flowing point of
the solder. The copper may be heated in a gas furnace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
especially made for soldering coppers, or over
an ordinary gas stove burner or a common blue
flame oil stove, or a charcoal fire, a wood fire burned
down to embers, or a plumbers’ gasoline torch, but
never in a coal fire. Coal contains too much sulphur
which oxidizes the copper and renders it useless for
soldering purposes.</p>

<p><b>The Blue Flame Oil Stove.</b>—For heating the
coppers in my country shop, I use a blue flame oil
stove, one of the less expensive sort, with the
asbestos ring wick and the short removable chimneys.
The stove has two burners and will heat from
four to six coppers at once. The flames may be
regulated nicely so as to give just the required
amount of heat and this stove consumes very little
kerosene, and, therefore, costs little to operate. In
<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>, it will be noticed that there is a curved hood
over each stove hole. These hoods may be easily
made from part of a large can or of a piece of tin
or sheet iron bent into shape. These hoods conserve
the heat and throw it about the coppers. I also place
a piece of heavy wire netting over the grating of the
stove holes to support the coppers and to permit
their being laid to one side, out of the intense heat,
when not immediately needed.</p>

<p>The blue flame oil stove forms the most satisfactory
arrangement for heating coppers that I have
ever used in the country. These stoves are easily
taken care of and are understood by almost everyone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
The directions should be nailed up alongside
the stove and carefully followed, particularly as to
cleaning the burners once or twice each season.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;" id="fig16">
<img src="images/figure16.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Gasoline Torch.</b>—The plumbers’ gasoline
torch is often used by experienced metal workers
for heating coppers. In inexperienced hands, this
torch is rather a dangerous affair. Only one copper
may be heated at a time and it is difficult not to overheat
the copper in the fierce roaring flame. The
cost of the torch and the cost of operating it are
both greater than the blue flame kerosene stove.
However, in experienced hands, it is safe enough
and very useful about the shop. In using such a
torch the directions should be most carefully followed;
all joints, filler openings, etc., must be airtight
when operating or a disastrous fire or explosion
may result. The tiny jet opening in the burner
must be kept clean.</p>

<p><b>The Gas Furnace.</b>—In my winter shop in the
city where gas is available, I use the gas furnace
shown in <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>. This is a most satisfactory and
widely used heater for soldering coppers, as it gives
an intense blue flame that may be easily regulated.</p>

<p>When using a heater of this sort, one must be
sure that it is lighted correctly or a smoky yellow
flame will result. To produce a blue flame, air must
be mixed with the gas; just as it is in a bunsen
burner or an ordinary gas stove, for that matter.
Gas is admitted to the furnace through a small nozzle
at the end of the mixing flue near the rubber hose
connection. Air is admitted in the slot under the
gas nozzle; a movable slide encircles the mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
flue over the slot to control the amount of air admitted.
This slide must be tightly closed over the
air vent when the gas is first turned on.</p>

<p>To light the heater, close the air inlet tightly,
turn the gas on full and apply a lighted match to
the burner. A yellow flame will result. Now open
the air vent slowly, by pushing the slide forward a
little way. The flame will change from yellow to
blue and purple as air is admitted. When the flame
is blue, it is giving out the most heat and is in the
best condition to heat the copper.</p>

<p>If the flame fires back and lights the gas at the
brass nozzle over the air inlet, the gas should be
turned off until the flame disappears. The air inlet
is then closed, and the gas turned on and lighted, and
then the air inlet is slowly opened until the flame
turns blue. When the furnace is in use, it should be
looked at occasionally to see that the flame has not
fired back to the nozzle. Once satisfactorily lighted,
the heater may be turned up or down as needed. If
the flame is turned down very low the air inlet may
have to be closed a bit to prevent the flame from
firing back. The copper is placed on the rest provided
for it over the flame. After the copper is
heated to the flowing point of solder, the flame may
be turned down or the copper placed to one side of
the flame, so that it does not get too hot.</p>

<p><b>Charcoal and Wood Fires.</b>—When using a charcoal
or a wood fire, the copper should be placed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the bottom among the embers. Small charcoal furnaces
used for heating soldering coppers may be
bought from the dealer in plumbers’ supplies. Charcoal
should not be burned in a closed room as the
fumes are deadly unless allowed plenty of constantly
changing air. These furnaces may be connected
with a chimney or burned in a room with
windows opened, without danger.</p>

<p>A soldering copper may be heated in the glowing
embers of a camp fire or in the embers in a fireplace.</p>

<p><b>Electrical Soldering Coppers.</b>—The electrically
heated copper is ideal for soldering as the heating
coil is enclosed within the copper itself, the wire running
out through the handle and connecting with an
ordinary electric light socket. The heat is maintained
at a proper degree for melting the solder;
hence it is an ideal equipment for those who can
afford it and where electric current is available. The
doctors of certain hospitals have recommended
electrical coppers for the use of patients in making
tin can toys.</p>

<p>An electric soldering copper costs about $7.50
at the present time.</p>

<p><b>The Common Soldering Copper.</b>—A suitable
soldering copper or “iron” may be purchased at any
good tool dealer’s or hardware store; it should
weigh about one pound for work with the tin cans.</p>

<p>Almost everyone has purchased a small soldering
outfit at one time or another and tried to solder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the family wash-boiler or some leaky tinware; usually
without success. Such outfits are invariably too
small for large work or for the tin can toys.</p>

<p>It must be well remembered that the heat flows
from the copper into the work, and that the copper
has to heat up the work to the melting point of the
solder; hence a large copper weighing several
pounds is used to solder wash-boilers, tin roofs, etc.,
and a small copper weighing a few ounces is used
for soldering jewelry, etc.</p>

<p>A large copper in expert hands may be used to
solder very small work but a small copper may never
be used to solder large work together, because the
copper not only has to keep the solder melted to the
flowing point, but also has to heat the work itself at
the joint to the flowing point of the solder before the
solder will leave the copper and adhere to the work.</p>

<p>In actual practice, it has been found that a copper
weighing one pound is best. After one gets
more adept with the copper, it will be found advantageous
to have several coppers of different weights.
A half pound and also a four ounce copper will be
found very convenient for extremely small work.
But, do not begin to solder with a copper weighing
less than one pound.</p>

<p>Soldering coppers are usually sold in pairs at
the large tool dealers, and coppers listed at two
pounds really weigh one pound each; when sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in a written order be sure that you specify that the
copper is to weigh one pound singly.</p>

<p>A wooden handle especially made for soldering
coppers should be purchased at the same time as the
copper; these wooden handles are made large to protect
the hand from the heat of the iron shank. The
handle is usually furnished with a hole of the proper
size drilled in it to permit the pointed end of the
shank to be driven in the handle easily with a wooden
mallet. If the hole is too small, it should be drilled
out so that it is nearly as large as the diameter of
the shank. The wooden handle must not be split
when driven on with the mallet.</p>

<p><b>Fluxes.</b>—Before tinning the point of the copper,
some flux must be obtained, either a soldering paste
or soldering fluid “killed acid.”</p>

<p>An excellent soldering paste called “Nokorode”
is by far the best flux obtainable. It is inexpensive,
a little goes a long way, and it will not rust or
corrode the work as is the case with killed acid and
some soldering pastes. It may be easily cleaned from
the work after soldering and it makes soldering
much easier and simpler for the beginner. Nokorode
soldering paste may be obtained at any good electrical
supply house or hardware store. If they do
not stock it, they will get it for you. There is nothing
else just as good on the market, but if for any
reason you cannot obtain this particular brand, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sure that any soldering paste you buy is plainly
labelled that it will not corrode the work.</p>

<p>Soldering fluid or killed acid is made of muriatic
acid in which is dissolved all the pure zinc that
it will hold in solution. This fluid is much used by
tinners and is certainly an excellent soldering flux,
but not nearly as good as the soldering paste for
our purposes. However, it is very useful in the
shop to dip the tinned point of the hot copper into
it to remove the oxide or dirt formed after the
copper has been in use for some time. The solder
will stick to the point much better after the copper
has been cleaned in this manner.</p>

<p>Directions for making the killed acid and the use
of other soldering fluxes will be found on <a href="#Page_68">page 68</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tinning the Copper.</b>—Having procured the
soldering copper and handle, some flux and soft
solder, and having fixed up some sort of heating
apparatus, the next step toward soldering is to coat
the point of the copper with solder: this is called
tinning the copper.</p>

<p>Fix the copper firmly in a vise if one is at hand,
as illustrated in <a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>. Then file each of the
four faces of the point of the copper bright and
clean with a flat file. It is better to use an old file
for this purpose—one with rather coarse teeth. It
will be observed that the copper is placed slantwise
in the vise so as to bring one face of the square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
pyramid parallel with the vise jaws; this position
permits filing in a natural horizontal position.</p>

<p>Each face of the point should be rounded slightly
toward the point.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;" id="fig17">
<img src="images/figure17.jpg" width="300" height="315" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If a vise is not available, the copper may be held
against the edge of the bench with one hand and the
point filed clean and bright with the file held in the
other, or a coarse sheet of emery cloth may be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
flat on the table and each face of the point rubbed
bright on it. A file is by far the best for this purpose,
however, and if it is chalked before using, the
copper filed away will not clog it.</p>

<p>When the copper is clean and bright at the
point each face should be thoroughly covered with
a thin film of soldering paste or dipped into the
soldering acid.</p>

<p>The copper should then be placed in the fire and
heated to the melting point of the solder.</p>

<p><b>Heating.</b>—While the copper is heating get ready
a piece of tin about 2 by 4 inches—any clean flat
scrap or part of a can will do. Spread a little soldering
paste into the center of the tin and lay it on the
bench near the heating apparatus. A few drops of
killed acid may be placed on the tin instead of the
paste, if the acid is to be used.</p>

<p>After a few minutes heating the copper should
be removed from the fire and the end of a strip of
solder touched to the point. If the solder melts
quickly and easily against the point the copper is
ready to tin; if it melts very slowly, “slushy”, the
copper should be returned to the fire and heated a
bit more. <em>The copper should never be heated
red hot under any circumstances</em>; this must be
borne in mind. If the copper is heated to a red heat,
the soldering paste will be burned off and its action
destroyed, for a red hot copper will not pick up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
solder, nor may it be tinned again until the copper is
cool and refiled bright and clean, recoated with flux
and reheated. If the copper is heated red hot after
the point is tinned, the tinning is burned from the
point and solder will not stick to it until it has been
cooled, refiled and retinned.</p>

<p><em>This is the most important point to remember
about soldering and is the cause of many failures.</em>
Remember that soldering is impossible without a
flux to keep the metal clean when it is hot; too much
heat will burn soldering paste or killed acid away;
the tinning and the solder adhering to the point
will be burned or oxidized and rendered brittle
and useless.</p>

<p>A heat that will melt the solder almost instantly
and cause it to flow with a brilliant glistening color
should be maintained at all times when the copper
is employed for soldering. <em>This is never a red heat.</em></p>

<p>When the copper is first heated to be tinned, it
should be removed from the fire when it melts the
solder easily, and several large drops of solder
should then be melted from the bar or strip of
solder onto the piece of tin placed by the fire and
on which some soldering paste or acid has been
spread. Rub each face of the point of the copper
into the solder on the tin until each face is thoroughly
covered with a bright coating of solder.
Hold each face flatly down against the solder on the
tin during the rubbing process. The copper may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have to be heated once or twice by the beginner, as
it may get too cool to melt the solder easily. As
soon as the solder begins to work stiffly, “slushy,”
and looks gray instead of glistening, it is time to
reheat the copper.</p>

<p>An old piece of soft cotton cloth, such as a stocking,
on which is sprinkled a little powdered sal-ammoniac
is an excellent thing to keep handy when
soldering or tinning. The tin coating of the point of
the copper should be rubbed on this cloth where the
sal-ammoniac is sprinkled, when the copper is hot.
This will be found to keep the copper in excellent
condition. The sal-ammoniac removes the oxide
from the tinning and brightens it up generally about
the point.</p>

<p>The tinning will last much longer on the copper
if it is dipped occasionally into the soldering paste or
acid while hot. This is particularly true if the copper
has been a bit overheated.</p>

<p>When the tinning shows signs of wearing off and
the copper does not pick up solder readily, it must
be retinned, filed, fluxed, heated, and rubbed on the
solder which has been put on the tin first used for
this purpose. This piece of tin should be kept about
the bench, as the copper will have to be retinned frequently.
<em>Always remember that the copper will not
carry solder to the work unless it is well tinned.</em></p>

<p>If an electrical soldering copper is used it is usually
furnished already tinned at the point, so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
is ready for use as soon as it is connected to a suitable
electric socket and the current turned on. The
heating coil inside the copper will soon heat it up to
the melting point of the solder. After heating, it
may be treated as a common copper, wiped occasionally
on the cotton cloth and retinned when the
tinning is worn away. An electrical copper should
never be placed in a vise for filing, but should be held
against the bench and filed carefully. A vise is
apt to crush the hollow copper and injure the heating
coil inside. These coppers should never be
placed in a fire or heated in any way except by the
electric current.</p>

<p>Electrical coppers do not need as much attention
as an ordinary copper for the even heat supplied
by the current keeps the copper heated to the
flowing point of the solder and is incapable of heating
beyond this temperature.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Make Soldering Fluid or “Killed
Acid”</span></h3>

<p>Soldering fluid may be very simply made as
follows: Pure zinc is dissolved in muriatic acid until
the acid will not dissolve any more of the zinc. The
solution thus obtained is then allowed to stand for
a time and is then strained through a cloth and
poured into a bottle which is kept tightly corked
when not in use.</p>

<p>First purchase about six ounces of muriatic acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
from a druggist. Take care not to spill any of this
acid on the hands or clothes. Next get some pure
sheet zinc. The sheet zinc employed for stove mats
as it is sold in the plumbers’ shops is not suitable for
making soldering fluid, as this form of zinc is
alloyed with other metals. Pure zinc may be very
easily obtained from old dry batteries which may
be found anywhere.</p>

<p>Remove the paper covering from the battery and
crack it open with a hammer—remove the carbon
from the center of the battery and dump out all the
powdered material. Soak the zinc covering of the
battery in warm water to remove any paper or material
adhering to the zinc and then cut the zinc into
pieces about ¼ inch square.</p>

<p>Find an old tea cup or earthen-ware marmalade
jar and pour into it about half a teacupful of the
muriatic acid. Set the vessel containing the acid out
of doors or near an open window and away from all
steel tools, so that the fumes of the acid may escape
and not be breathed into the lungs or rust any tools.</p>

<p>Pour a small handful of the zinc cuttings into
the acid. The acid will attack them at once and a
strong bubbling action will result. When the bubbling
action dies down add more zinc cuttings—about
every fifteen minutes. When the acid shows
no sign of attacking the zinc as it is added, the acid
is said to be “killed” and the soldering fluid is
made. It may be used at once if necessary, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
will be much better if it is allowed to stand over
night with the zinc residue left in it. It is then
strained through a piece of muslin cloth into another
cup or jar and the fluid is ready for use.</p>

<p>Soldering fluid may be kept in a wide-mouthed
glass bottle or a marmalade jar; either vessel must
be tightly corked when not in use. This soldering
fluid may be used as a flux for any soft soldering
operation in place of the soldering paste, but it is not
as satisfactory a flux for the tin can work as the
paste. The best use for it in connection with the tin
can toys is to keep it to dip the point of the hot
copper in occasionally to clean the tinning at the
point of the copper.</p>

<p>While the prepared soldering paste is best for
all soldering operations connected with the tin work,
other fluxes may be used if nothing better is at
hand. These are resin, olive oil, cottonseed oil,
automobile lubricating oil, and paraffin; but these
fluxes are not very satisfactory in inexperienced
hands. The soldering paste is best for all soldering
operations.</p>

<p>PREPARING A JOINT FOR SOLDERING—CLEANING AND
SCRAPING—SOLDERING A PRACTICE PIECE—SOLDERING
THE HANDLE TO THE BISCUIT CUTTER—A
SECOND PRACTICE PIECE—ANOTHER METHOD
OF APPLYING SOLDER</p>

</div>

<p><b>Cleaning and Scraping.</b>—If the copper is thoroughly
tinned and the heater and materials are ready
for use as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>, then several
practice pieces should be soldered together before
attempting a joining on any real work you may have
ready to solder.</p>

<p>If the tin is bright and clean, it need not be
scraped at the joint where the solder is to go. Rusty
spots should be scraped bright if in the path of the
solder. Paper, labels or paint must be cleaned away.
If a can has been well rinsed with hot water when
the contents are emptied, it will present no difficulties
to the soldering, but a can that has been emptied but
not rinsed presents a more difficult surface to solder;
particularly tomato, fruit, or condensed milk cans.
This, of course, applies only to the inside of these
cans. Tobacco, coffee, cocoa, tea cans and the like
offer no resistance to the solder without washing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
The yellow lacquer used to line some cans need not
be scraped off. Solder will adhere well to tin so
treated, but paper, paint, etc., must be scraped from
the path of the solder. The scraped part need only
be a quarter of an inch in width on each side of the
joint; the rest of the paper labels or paint will be
removed in the hot lye bath used before painting
the can.</p>

<p>The scraping may be done with an old knife, or
a regular scraper furnished by the dealer in tinners’
tools as illustrated on <a href="#Page_202">page 202, Chapter XXI</a>.</p>

<p>When scraping the tin bright, do not scrape it
so hard that all the tin will be scraped away from
the inner sheet of iron, as solder will stick to tin
much better than to iron. If the tin is not very dirty,
a piece of emery cloth or sand paper may be used
to clean the joint.</p>

<p>Paint cans, cans that have contained stove blacking,
rubber cement, varnish, shellac, etc., should be
thoroughly boiled in a strong lye bath before soldering;
paint is usually made of oxides and oxides are a
sure preventive of soldering. The lye bath is
made by adding two heaping tablespoonfuls of lye
or washing soda to the gallon of boiling water.
Cans boiled in this solution for five minutes will be
thoroughly cleaned and free from paint, paper
labels, and practically anything likely to be found
inside or outside of a can. The lye or washing soda
may be obtained at any grocery store. Care should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
be taken not to get any of the lye solution on the
hands or the clothes as it is very caustic and will
burn the hands and ruin the clothes if not immediately
washed off. The work should be handled with
a wire hook while in the bath and well rinsed with
water when removed from it. The same lye bath is
used before paint is applied to tin work, when all
forming, soldering, riveting, etc., is done. It removes
the flux, acid, and finger marks, leaving a
clean surface on which to paint.</p>

<p><b>Soldering a Practice Piece.</b>—For practice in
soldering, an angle joint is a good thing to begin
with; something that is small and easily held in position
while being soldered. As I have already described
the forming up of a biscuit cutter to the
point of soldering it together, a practice piece resembling
it will be an excellent thing with which
to begin.</p>

<p>Cut a narrow strip of tin about 1 inch wide and
4 inches long and a flat piece of tin about 2 by 3
inches. Be sure that the ends of the narrow strip
are cut squarely across, using the square if necessary.
(See <a href="#Page_32">chapter on “Laying Out Work,” page
32</a>.) See to it that both pieces are well flattened
out and smooth.</p>

<p>Bend the narrow strip into a semi-circular form,
like the biscuit cutter you have already to solder
and stand this piece in position on the larger flat
piece of tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Now lay the piece near the soldering copper
heater, on the wooden bench; be sure to place it on
wood, not on a part of the vise or any other metal
that may be convenient. Iron, stone or brick will
absorb too much heat from the tin if directly under
and in contact with it, and thus prevent soldering.</p>

<p>Apply a small amount of soldering paste to each
joint as indicated in <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>. The paste may be
applied with a small flat stick of wood such as a
match stick shaved down to a long, thin, wedge point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig18">
<img src="images/figure18.jpg" width="300" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Killed acid or soldering fluid is usually applied
with a small camel’s-hair brush set in a quill; sometimes
a chicken feather is used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The flux, whether paste or acid, should be
applied sparingly, but be sure that enough is applied
to thoroughly cover the joint, as if it were painted
on both sides of the metal where it joins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>See to it that the copper is well tinned and
heated until it will melt and take up a good sized
drop of solder at the point when held against a bar
or strip of solder. Wire or strip solder is much
easier for the beginner to handle than the heavier
bar. It melts far more easily, as it is smaller.</p>

<p>If bar solder is used, place it on an anvil or stone
and hammer one end out, until it is about ⅛ inch
thick and much wider than the original bar. It
will melt off much more quickly when thinned out.</p>

<p>Hold the semi-circular piece in position with
the left hand and with the right bring the hot copper
charged with molten solder at the tinned point and
fit the point of the copper closely into the angle
formed by the joint, moving the copper very slowly
along the joint, starting at one side and finishing at
the other.</p>

<p>When each side of the joint is thoroughly heated
up to the melting point of the solder, some of the
solder will leave the copper and flow into and over
the joint; so that when starting to solder a joint the
copper should be allowed to rest a moment where the
soldering is to be started. The tin is then heated up
and when the solder starts to flow into the joint, the
copper is drawn slowly along, heating up the tin,
and as it travels flowing the solder into the joint.</p>

<p>The following points should be well remembered
when soldering:</p>

<p>That the tin, to be soldered, must be heated up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the melting point of the solder before the solder will
leave the copper and adhere to the tin.</p>

<p>That the copper supplies the
heat to the tin and that the tin will
not be heated unless the copper is
kept in contact with it long enough
to heat it. Enough of the copper
should be in contact with the tin to
be soldered for the heat to flow
quickly into the tin, see <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>.
Do not merely touch the point of
the copper to the joint and expect
it to heat that joint: it won’t. Two
faces of the point of the copper
should rest against the parts
of the work to be soldered,
thus transmitting heat to the
pieces as shown in <a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>. If
too much of the point is allowed
to come in contact with
the work, the solder will be
smeared over the work in a
broad unnecessary stream. This
is the reason that the points
of coppers are filed slightly rounding
toward the point.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;" id="fig19">
<img src="images/figure19.jpg" width="150" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></p>
</div>

<p><em>Remember</em>: That the copper must be hot enough
to make the solder glisten.</p>

<p>That a red-hot copper will not pick up solder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>That a red-hot copper burns away the flux, and
that it destroys the tinning at the point of the copper;
a red head also oxidizes the solder, making it
brittle and weak.</p>

<p>That solder will not fill up a gap in a joint unless
in very expert hands; joints should fit closely.</p>

<p>That a good joint should appear smooth; look
as if painted on. A smooth joint is produced by a
hot copper, clean metal, and good flux, but most of
all, by leaving the copper long enough in the joint to
heat it thoroughly.</p>

<p>That small joints are heated and soldered almost
instantly.</p>

<p>That large joints require a longer time to heat
up and that very heavy work requires a large copper
and sometimes an outside source of heat as well—but
we have nothing to do with such work in
this book.</p>

<p>That work must be held together until the solder
sets or turns gray, as it may spring apart while the
solder is molten.</p>

<p>These are all very simple facts and should not be
difficult to remember.</p>

<p>To continue with the practice piece: As soon as
the solder has run in and around one end of the
practice joint, remove the copper and solder the
joint at the other end of the piece. As these joints
are small, they should heat up and solder very
quickly. One heating of the copper should do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
both joints, but be sure that the copper is hot enough
before you try the second joint.</p>

<p>If difficulty is experienced in making your first
joint and it does not stick together, apply more flux
and try again.</p>

<p>The handle may be soldered to the biscuit cutter
in the same manner after the practice piece is successfully
completed.</p>

<p><b>Another Method of Applying Solder.</b>—Sometimes
bits of solder may be cut from the strip of
wire solder and placed in the joint to be soldered.
The hot soldering copper is then used to melt the
solder into the joint. The joint must be well fluxed
before the solder is placed in position.</p>

<p>The end of a strip of wire solder is sometimes
held against the point of a hot copper as it is moved
along a joint to be soldered. The solder is fed
against the point of the hot copper as it melts into
the joint.</p>

<p>Both of the above methods will be found advantageous
when a gaping joint is to be filled with solder
and it is desirable to apply a quantity of solder in
one place.</p>

<p>THE PINE TREE DESIGN—CUTTING NARROW STRIPS
OF TIN—BENDING TO SHAPE OVER DESIGN—SOLDERING
COOKY CUTTERS—THE HANDLE</p>

</div>

<p>Cooky cutters of any simple design may easily
be made from strips and pieces of tin cut from cans.
They may be made to stamp out any simple design
from the cake dough, such as flowers, leaves, trees,
animals, boats, various insignia, etc.</p>

<p>When making the design for a cooky cutter, remember
that raisins, currants, pieces of citron, nuts,
etc., may be added to the cookies after stamping
them out and used to accentuate the design, as eyes
of animals, fruit on trees, etc.</p>

<p>First draw the design on paper exactly the same
size you wish the cooky to be and be sure to use a
very simple outline, taking care not to introduce too
many intricate bends and to remember that a strip
of tin must be bent to follow the outline of the drawing.
Also remember that cake dough is not of very
tough material and will easily break if cut in too
narrow a strip in any place or part of the design.</p>

<p>Do not try to make too realistic a design but
rather one that suggests the desired object. The
pine or Christmas tree design is a very simple one
to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Pine Tree Design.</b>—First draw the pine
tree on paper, taking care to have both sides of the
tree alike, <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>. A very simple method of obtaining
this result is to fold the paper exactly in half,
open the paper out flat again and draw one-half of
the tree, using the folded line as
the center of the tree and using
a soft pencil to draw with. Fold
the paper together again using
the same fold line, place the folded
paper on a hard surface and rub
the paper over the drawing with
the bowl of a spoon so that the
design is transferred to the other
half of the paper, so that when
the paper is unfolded the design will
be completed and both sides of the design will
be alike.</p>

<p><b>Cutting Narrow Strips of Tin.</b>—When you have
a satisfactory design drawn, cut open a large can so
that when the tin from the can is flattened out you
may cut from it a strip long enough to bend around
and conform to your design and have only one joint.
Be sure to trim up one edge of the tin to a straight
line before starting to mark off a strip ½ inch in
width, using the dividers for the marking operation
as shown in <a href="#Page_35">Chapter II, page 35</a>. Be sure to cut
your strip as straight as possible and of exactly the
same width for its entire length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bending to Shape Over Design.</b>—When the strip
is cut, bring the ends of the strip together and press
the bend in to form an angle. This angle will not
only form the top of the tree but will mark the
center of the strip as well. Bend the strip apart
until it conforms to the design on paper from the
top of the tree to the first bend on one side as shown
in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>. Mark the strip of tin at <i>A. A.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig21">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Take the flat-nosed pliers and bend the tin in on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
each side to conform to the line <i>B.</i> Let the ends of
the strip go past each other as shown in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>, 2,
and in the illustration of bending. Next bend both
ends of the strip at <i>C. C.</i> and so on until the complete
outline of the tree drawn on paper is followed by
the strip of tin. The various steps in the bending
are shown in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>, 1 to 6. The joint at the
bottom of the design should overlap about ¼ inch.</p>

<p>This joint may be held together with the flat-nosed
pliers and soldered. Take care to have the
ends that are to be soldered square with the rest of
the design so that when the cutting strip is placed
flat down on the cutting board all the cutting edges
will touch evenly and cut well.</p>

<p>When you have the ends of the cutting strip
soldered together, cut out a rectangular piece of tin
somewhat larger than the design, at least ¼ inch
larger in every direction. See that this piece of tin
is perfectly flat and free from wrinkles.</p>

<p>Look carefully at the cutting strip and see that
it conforms closely to the design and then lay it in
the center of the rectangular piece of tin.</p>

<p>Secure a thin piece of wood slightly larger than
the design. Wood from a packing box will do.</p>

<p>This strip of wood is held in place on top of the
cutting strip in order to hold it when soldering the
strip to keep it perfectly flat, and to prevent burning
the fingers. The cutting strip gets very hot when it
is being soldered in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Soldering Cooky Cutters Together.</b>—See that
your soldering copper is well heated and tinned;
apply soldering paste to the entire joint where the
cutting strip rests on the flat piece of tin and then
apply the solder carefully in the usual manner with
the hot soldering copper.</p>

<p>It will be found comparatively easy to apply
solder to the longer parts of the strip, such as those
forming the sides of the tree,
but do not attempt to solder in
the narrow crevice or crevices
formed between the tree foliage,
the trunk, and the top.
Solder only where it is easy to
introduce the point of the
soldering copper, then apply
solder inside that part of the
design forming the tree trunk
as illustrated in <a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a> by the dark lines.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;" id="fig22">
<img src="images/figure22.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The cutting strip need not be soldered to the flat
piece of tin forming the back in every small crevice
that is not convenient to the soldering copper. But
it must be soldered in such a way as to prevent the
cutting strip from bending out of shape when used
for cutting. So, if you may not solder it outside,
solder it inside.</p>

<p>Be sure and hold the cutting strip firmly down
to the flat tin with a flat piece of wood when soldering.
If the soldering does not go along well, stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and read over Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a> on soldering.
Take plenty of time and make a good job of it.</p>

<p>When the cutting strip is firmly soldered to the
tin, trim away the edges until they appear as shown in
<a href="#plate8">Plate VIII</a>. Do not try to follow every indentation
in the design but cut to the general smooth shape
indicated which leaves no sharp corners. The edges
of the tin forming the back of the cutter may be
smoothed over with a small piece of fine emery cloth
or fine sand-paper. Rubbing the edges gently with the
emery cloth will dull them so that they are less apt
to cut the fingers. This applies only to the flat piece
of tin forming the back or top of the cutter, for the
edges of the cutting strip should be left sharp.</p>

<p>Punch two or more holes through the back of the
cooky cutter to form air vents as you did when
making the biscuit cutter.</p>

<p><b>The Handle.</b>—A handle may be made for the
cooky cutter in exactly the same way as the handle
made for the biscuit cutter. A strip of tin 1¼ inches
wide and 4 inches long, is about the right size for
the handle. The edges are folded in and the strip is
rounded over an anvil and soldered into place as
indicated in the photograph.</p>

<p>The edges of the handle should rest directly over
the cutting strip under it.</p>

<p>When finished, the cooky cutter should be boiled
up in the lye bath or washed with hot water and
strong soap and then it is ready for use.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>TURNING OVER EDGES ON ROUND TRAYS—USING THE
FORMING MALLET—MAKING AN ASH TRAY AND
MATCH BOX HOLDER</p>

</div>

<p>Various round trays may be made from tin
cans. These are very simple to make and are very
attractive and convenient for ash trays, bottle
casters and the like. A match box holder may be
soldered to the center of the tray and any smoker
will appreciate this. These simple trays have
proved to be one of the most popular problems for
certain wounded soldiers in an American base hospital
in France.</p>

<p><b>Turning Over Edges on Round Trays.</b>—Select
a rather large can to cut down for a tray. A can
from 4 to 6 inches in diameter is best with which to
start tray making. This can should be round, as the
square cans are very difficult, if not impossible, to
handle when turning over an edge.</p>

<p>Set the dividers to 1¼ inches and scribe a line
parallel to the bottom of the can. Cut the can down
and be careful to cut it off as straight as possible at
the scribed line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Place a square maple block in the vise; the same
maple block you have used for turning the edges of
the handle for the biscuit cutter. Be sure that the
edges of the block are square and sharp.</p>

<p>Set the dividers to ¼ inch, rest one leg of the
dividers on the rim of the tray and scribe a line
around the inside, ¼ inch down from the edge, as
indicated in <a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig23">
<img src="images/figure23.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Rest the edge of the tray on the edge of the
wooden block so that the line scribed ¼ inch down
from the edge rests directly over the edge of the
block as indicated in <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a> a.</p>

<p>Tilt the tray back on the block until the edge is
raised about ⅟₁₆ inch up from the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
block, the line still resting directly over the edge
of the block.</p>

<p><b>Using the Forming Mallet.</b>—Take up the special
forming mallet and use the rounded end to start
hammering the tin down to the block, still keeping
the tray tilted as indicated in <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a> <i>b</i>. Turn the
tray around as you hammer so that the tray is
slightly flanged out by the mallet blows as you turn
it around on the block.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig24">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/figure24a.jpg" width="200" height="225" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 24<i>b</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Be sure to hammer the tin very gently and evenly,
taking care not to stretch it down more in one place
than another. Tin will stand considerable stretching
if handled gently and evenly, but heavy mallet
blows will stretch and crack it, and it will tear if
unevenly stretched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Never raise the edge of the tray away from the
block more than ⅟₁₆ of an inch, but always tilt the
tray back a little more each time you hammer entirely
around it. The tin will quickly flange out and
after having hammered entirely around the tray
three or four times, the rim should flange out to
about the angle indicated in <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>, No. <span class="smcapuc">III.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;" id="fig25">

<img src="images/figure26.jpg" width="190" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Try to hammer in such a way as to flange the
tin over evenly from the scribed line. The mallet
blows should be directed in toward the line which
always rests at the edge of the block, rather than
toward the edge of the tin.</p>

<p>When the edge has been turned over as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
indicated in <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>, No. <span class="smcapuc">III</span>, change the position of
the tray and rest the bottom of it on the top of the
block and hammer gently on the edge as indicated in
<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a> until the edge or flange stands out at right
angles to the side of the tray. Continue hammering
until the edge of the tray stands at about the angle
indicated in <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>, No. <span class="smcap">V</span>.</p>

<p>Remove the maple block from the vise and
secure a round wooden mallet in it, the mallet being
about 2½ or 3 inches in diameter, or a piece of iron
pipe, if held in the vise, may be used for an anvil
instead of the mallet.</p>

<p>Hang the tray over the end of the mallet or pipe
and hold it firmly in position, turning it slowly
around the anvil as the edge is hammered down to
the side of the tray, <a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<p>Do not try to hammer the edge down all at once,
but go entirely around the turned flange or edge several
times with the mallet, hammering very lightly
and bending the edge down more each time the tray
is hammered around. The flanges or turned part
will wrinkle slightly during the turning, but if the
edge has been turned evenly and slowly from the
start, this wrinkling will not matter, as the wrinkles
will gradually hammer out. Try to hammer in such
a way that the edge or top of the tray will remain
rounded and not get hammered together (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>When the edge is turned completely in and
touches the sides, reverse the forming mallet and use
the wedge-shaped end to hammer the wrinkles out,
taking care to hammer inside the edge so as not to
flatten the edge of the tray, <a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>. The edge should
look like <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>, and then your tray is finished and
ready to be boiled up in the lye solution and painted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;" id="fig27">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The edges of the tray may be made of any height
that suits the maker, but
never try to turn over less
than ¼ inch at the edge
nor any more than ⅜ inch,
as either operation is very
difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>The tin is taken up considerably
in the turning
and the ¼ inch marked off
for the turned edge of the tray described above will
be about ³⁄₁₆ of an inch when turned.</p>

<p>This turning operation is used a great deal for
finishing the edges of different cylindrical and
curved surfaces used in the tin can work, as a sharp
thin edge should never be left about the work.</p>

<p><b>Making an Ash Tray and Match Box Holder.</b>—Make
a tray about 6 inches in diameter and ¾
of an inch in height when the edge is turned over,
and then find a smaller can about 2½ inches in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
such as a soup or baking powder can. Scribe
a line around this can 1 inch from the base. Cut the
can down to this line and place the can bottom up in
the center of the bottom of the first tray, holding it
in position with a stick of wood and soldering it
to the tray.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Open a box of safety matches and measure the
diameter of the end of the box part that holds the
matches. The usual measurement of the end of the
inside box is ⅝ by 1⅜ inches.</p>

<p>Cut a strip of tin ⅝ of an inch wide and 2⅛
inches long. Make a mark ½ inch from each end
of the strip and bend the tin at right angles at each
end, using each mark for the bend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The strip should then appear as shown in Fig.
29, <i>A</i>. Solder this strip in the center of the small
can as shown in <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>, <i>B</i>, but make sure that the
cover of the match box will slide over it before soldering
it fast.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of tin 1½ inches wide and 2½
inches in length. See
that they are cut perfectly
square. Mark
off a line ¼ inch in
from one end of each
piece and turn the tin
at right angles from
this mark to the edge.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;" id="fig30">
<img src="images/figure30.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The corners at the
opposite ends of
each piece should be
rounded off by cutting
with the shears as
shown in <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>, <i>C</i>.
Round over the edges
with some fine emery cloth. Place the cover of the
match box in position over the strip of tin soldered
to the can in the center of the tray. Place the two
pieces of tin against the two opposite sides of the
match box as shown in <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>. Then move them
slightly away from the box and mark the position of
the flanged ends where they rest on the can, remove
the box cover and solder these pieces of tin in place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Be sure to solder these pieces in such a way that the
match box cover will slip between them easily and fit
over the bent strip of tin at the bottom. The ash
tray and match box holder will then be completed
and ready for the lye bath and painting.</p>

<p>An extra coat of some high-grade spar varnish
should be given the ash trays to prevent the hot
ashes from burning the paint. This varnish should
only be applied after the first coat or coats of paint
are thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>The height of the trays at the edge may be
altered to suit and also the height and shape of the
can soldered to the center of the tray. The measurements
are merely given for convenience in working
out these first problems. Every effort should be
made to think out problems of your own, taking the
suggestions from the shapes of the cans themselves.
Thus a square can may be soldered in the center of
the tray, and small semi-cylindrical troughs of tin
may be soldered to the rim of the tray to hold
lighted cigars and cigarettes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>THE CANDLE SOCKET—CUTTING A HOLE IN THE DRIP
CUP—MAKING THE HANDLE</p>

</div>

<p>After the ash tray and match box holder is successfully
completed the next problem that should be
taken up is the tray candlestick, a photograph of
which is shown on the opposite page. This problem
presents some interesting and instructive forming
and soldering operations and should be made before
attempting to make the toy auto truck.</p>

<p>Two trays should first be made up—one to be
used for the base of the candlestick and one for the
drip cup. The edges of both trays should be turned
over carefully.</p>

<p><b>The Candle Socket.</b>—The next thing to be made
is the candle socket which is also used to connect
both trays. Cut a piece of tin 2¾ by 3½ inches,
set the dividers to ¼ inch and scribe a line ¼ inch
inside three edges of the piece as shown in <a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>,
No. 1. Clip off the corners and fold down the strip
marked <i>A</i>, flat against the tin. <i>C</i> and <i>B</i> should be
partially folded over but not closed up, <a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>,
No. 2. These two flaps, <i>C</i> and <i>B</i> are to be locked
together to form a locked seam as shown in No. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>If this seam or joint were merely lapped and
soldered together the candle socket would melt apart
if the candle should be allowed to burn down inside it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;" id="fig31">
<img src="images/figure31.jpg" width="275" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Place a small bar of iron in the vise jaws—this
bar or pipe should be about ¾ inch in diameter and
is used as an anvil over which to round up the
candle socket.</p>

<p>Lay the piece of tin that is to be used for the
candle socket over the anvil with the fold <i>A</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
uppermost—bend the tin around the anvil with the hand
or with light mallet blows, taking care not to close
up the flaps <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> as you round the piece over the
anvil. You will not be able to get the socket into a
perfect cylindrical shape at first and until <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
are fitted together as shown in No. 3. Simply round
the piece up as best you can until flap <i>B</i> fits into
flap <i>C</i>. Then use a pair
of flat-nosed pliers to
pinch <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> together
as shown in No. 4.</p>

<p>When the two seams
are fitted together or
locked the socket should
be again placed on the
bar and the hammering
continued until the
socket is cylindrical and the seam hammered together.</p>

<p>Examine a tin can—most of them have locked
seams at the side.</p>

<p>If carefully made, this socket should fit a common
candle which is ⅞ of an inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;" id="fig32">
<img src="images/figure32.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Cutting a Hole in the Drip Cup.</b>—When the
candle socket is completed, a hole should be cut for
it through the bottom of the drip cup. The socket
is slipped through this hole until the bottom of the
flange <i>A</i> rests against the bottom of the drip cup,
see <a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>. A small chisel should be used to cut
the hole through the bottom of the drip cup. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
drip cup is rested on a small block of wood which is
held in the vise jaws, and the chisel used in the
same manner as a punch, the end of the wooden
block supporting the tin as the chisel cuts through
it. The cutting edge of the chisel should be about
⅛-inch wide and should be very sharp. Such a chisel
may be purchased at most tool dealers or a ⅛-inch
nail-set may be purchased and the end ground to a
chisel point on a grindstone. A common steel nail
may be used for a chisel if the point is filed off
entirely and the end of the nail filed to a chisel point.
The shank of the nail should be ⅛ inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Set the bottom edge of the candle socket in the
center of the drip cup and trace a line around it with
a sharp pencil or a steel scriber. Then place the drip
cup on a block of wood and cut out the disk of tin
inside the line, using a series of chisel cuts to follow
the line. Take care not to cut the hole too large—it
should just fit the candle socket as shown in the sectional
drawing, <a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>. A half-round file may be
used to file away any rough or jagged edges left by
the chisel cutting.</p>

<p><b>Making the Handle.</b>—A handle should next be
made from a piece of tin 1½ by 8 inches. The
handle should be made tapering and a dimensioned
drawing for this is shown in <a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a>. When the
tin is cut to the shape shown the dividers should be
set to ³⁄₁₆ inch and a line scribed ³⁄₁₆ inch inside
each side of the handle. The tin should be folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
over on these lines so that the sides of the handle
will be nicely rounded and made stronger. Directions
for making a straight fold will be found on
<a href="#Page_50">page 50</a> and need not be repeated here as the operation
is very simple.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;" id="fig33">
<img src="images/figure33.jpg" width="350" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The handle should be shaped as shown in <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>.
It may be shaped or formed up by placing it over a
round anvil and using a mallet in exactly the same

the drip cup meet, as shown in <a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p>When the socket and the drip cup are soldered
together they should be set in position in the center
of the bottom tray and soldered in place. (The
candlestick will have a much better appearance if
the seams in the side of the drip cup, socket, and
bottom tray are in line with each other when the
candlestick is soldered together.)</p>

<p>The handle is the last thing to put in place and
it is soldered to the drip cup and to the bottom tray—which
will complete the candlestick.</p>

<p>Many pleasing varieties of this simple and practical
candlestick may be made by changing the diameter
and shape of the cans used for the trays and
the length of the candle socket and the shape of
the handle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>MAKING A PAIL FROM A TIN CAN—CUTTING AWAY
THE SURPLUS TIN AT THE RIM—FORMING THE
LUGS FOR THE HANDLE—RIVETING THE LUGS IN
POSITION—FORMING A WIRE HANDLE</p>

</div>

<p>Riveting is one of the most useful operations
connected with metal working of all kinds, and it is
very frequently used in tin working where it is not
advisable to join the metal with solder; or riveting
may be employed in connection with a soldered joint
to strengthen it and to prevent the joined pieces from
melting off, such as the lugs or handle holders on a
pail used for cooking, etc.</p>

<p>Riveting is a very simple operation. The rivets
are usually made with a flat or rounded head attached
to a short cylindrical shaft or shank. A hole is
punched through each piece of metal to be joined.
The pieces of metal are placed together so that the
holes are in line and a rivet shank slipped through
these holes. The head of the rivet is then rested on
a flat iron or steel anvil and the headless end is hammered
over until it forms into a second head and
thus holds the two pieces of metal tightly together.</p>

<p>The pail offers a very simple problem in riveting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and it is very easy to make a substantial pail from
a tin can.</p>

<p><b>Making a Pail.</b>—Select a large, clean, round can
for the pail. A one-gallon fruit or vegetable can
makes up into a very useful pail. Use a can opener
to cut away the remaining tin of the lid but take care
not to mar the rim of the can. Rolled rim cans make
the best pails.</p>

<p>When the lid is cut away a jagged edge usually
remains near the rim and this must be trimmed away
and the remaining tin hammered down close to the
rim. If more than ¼ inch of the tin of the can lid
remains next to the rim of the can it should be
trimmed away with the metal shears until a strip of
tin remains next to the rim about ¼ inch wide.</p>

<p><b>Cutting Away Surplus Tin at the Rim.</b>—(A pair
of curved metal shears are very useful for making
circular cuts of this nature if you have them, but
the surplus tin may be trimmed away with the
straight shears if small cuts are taken with them.)
Cut into the tin next to the rim with the shears—the
cut should be made at right angles to the rim
and extend in to the rim. Now take a pair of strong
flat-nosed pliers and grasp the tin firmly with them
to the right of the cut and with a quick downward
motion of the plier jaws start to break away the tin
next to the rim as shown in <a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>. The tin will
break away at the angle of the lid and the rim and
should peel away easily with a series of quick downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
movements of the plier jaws—a fresh grip
should be taken for each downward movement of
the plier jaws and the ends of the plier jaws should be
pushed up against the rim each time that they are
moved into a new position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig36">
<img src="images/figure36.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When the tin is trimmed away place the rim of
the can on the end of the maple block and use the
rounded end of the forming mallet to hammer the
tin down tight to the rim, see <a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a>. The pail is
then ready for the lugs or handle-holding pieces at
the sides. These are to be soldered and riveted
in place.</p>

<p><b>Forming the Lugs for the Handle.</b>—Cut two
pieces of tin, each 1½ by 3½ inches, fold over
¼ inch on each of the long sides of these two pieces,
then double over each piece with the folds outside,
as shown in <a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>. Snip off the corners, then
place the lugs on the maple block and punch three
holes in about the position shown. See that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
holes are slightly larger than the shanks of the rivets
to be used, but do not get the holes very much larger
than the rivets.</p>

<p>Rivets are supplied by the hardware stores in
plain soft black iron and also tinned. The tinned
rivets are best for tin work as they may be easily
soldered to the work if necessary. These tinned
rivets are used for representing faucets, try-cocks,
etc., in making tin can toys. Several dozen or a box
of No. 14 Tinned Rivets should be purchased.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p><b>Riveting the Lugs in Position.</b>—Solder the two
lugs in position on each side of the top of the pail.
These two holes should come below the rim.</p>

<p>Place the pail over a round log of wood held in
the vise and punch the holes <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> through the tin of
the pail, using the holes previously punched in the
lugs of the pail as a guide.</p>

<p>Remove the log of wood from the vise and place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a large piece of round pipe in it for an anvil on which
to rivet. Push a rivet through the hole <i>A</i>, and place
the pail on the pipe in such a manner that the head
of the rivet rests on the iron pipe. Take a small
riveting hammer or a small machine hammer and
hammer down the small end of the rivet that projects
above the work, see <a href="#fig39">Figs. 39 and 40</a>. Hammer
rather gently using many light quick blows instead
of a few smashing heavy ones. The light blows tend
to form a better head on the rivet and to hold the
metal more securely in place.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>After you have had some experience in riveting,
you will find that the ball peen, or rounded end of a
machine hammer, is better to rivet with than a flat-ended
hammer.</p>

<p>When two rivets are placed in each of the lugs
the pail is ready for the handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Forming a Wire Handle.</b>—Pail handles may be
made of ⅛-inch galvanized wire or any piece of
strong, stiff wire that is handy. The galvanized
wire is best as it will not rust.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of wire 14 inches in length. Do not
try to cut this wire with your metal snips but use a
heavy pair of wire-cutting pliers if you have them. A
simple method of cutting wire is to place the wire in
the vise and use the corner of a file to cut through it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 250px;" id="fig41">
<img src="images/figure41.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="" />

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;" id="fig42">
<img src="images/figure42.jpg" width="200" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Trying to cut heavy wire with the metal shears
will ruin them; besides, you can’t do it.</p>

<p>Mark off 1¾ inches from each end of the piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of wire you have cut for the handle and bend each
end down at right angles from this mark, see
<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>This may be easily done by placing the wire in
the vise so that the mark for bending is held exactly
at the top of the vise jaws, then use a hammer to
bend the wire over at right angles, see <a href="#fig41">Fig. 41</a>.</p>

<p>Place the wire over the pipe held in the vise and
use a wooden mallet to round it over to the form
shown in <a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <i>B</i>. Slip the ends of the wire
handle through the holes punched for it in the lugs
on the pail and then turn the wire up at the ends with
a heavy pair of pliers until it looks as shown in
<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <i>C</i>, and the pail is completed.</p>

<p>If the pail described above is made of a rolled-rim
can it may be safely used for camp cooking, as
there is no danger that it will melt apart over the
fire. When a spout and a lid are added to the pail,
it will serve as an excellent coffee pot. A coffee pot
and other cooking utensils are shown in <a href="#fig95">Fig. 95</a>.</p>

<p>THE WHEELS—FOUR WAYS OF MAKING WHEELS OF
TIN CANS—MAKING A WHEEL FROM A CAN WITH
SOLDERED ENDS—MAKING WHEELS FROM ROLLED-RIM
CANS—TWO TYPES OF WHEELS MADE FROM
CAN LIDS</p>

</div>

<p>A very simple and strong toy automobile truck
may be made of tin cans. If the foregoing problems
have been carefully worked out, there is no
reason why one should find the truck difficult to
make, provided the directions are carefully followed.</p>

<p>As the construction of a truck is typical of so
many wheeled toys, it was selected as the best type
with which to begin. Various fittings may be added,
such as lights, fenders, running boards, handles, tool
boxes, etc., but only after the plain truck chassis,
hood, seat and wheels have been successfully
assembled. This first real problem in toy making
should be kept as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Wheels form the most important part of any
rolling toy, so these will be taken up first and each
method of making them discussed at length.</p>

<p><b>Four Ways of Making Wheels of Tin Cans.</b>—Both
types of tin cans may be used for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wheels, the rolled rim and the soldered flange can,
but the method of making the wheel is different for
each type of can. The press-in can lids from
molasses and syrup cans may also be used for
making wheels.</p>

<p><i>Making a Wheel from a Can with Soldered Ends.</i>—Suitable
truck wheels may be made from the
smallest size evaporated milk cans. Condensed milk
cans are too large for a small truck, though either
of the above mentioned cans have the soldered
flanged ends.</p>

<p>The contents of these evaporated milk cans is
usually poured through one of two holes punched
through the cover. This renders the cover practically
useless for making one side of the wheel,
unless the holes are small, so that eight cans will
have to be used for making four wheels.</p>

<p>If the cans are opened on the side with a can
opener but four cans need be used, as each end of
the can is then intact. These wheels are made by
removing one lid from the can, cutting the can down
to the required wheel width, and then soldering on
the lid again. When the ends of the can are intact,
the can is cut in two parts by cutting around the
sides of the can with the can opener. One part of
the can is cut down to the required height as in making
a tray; this height represents the width of the
wheel. The end is melted off the other part of the
can and this end is placed over the first part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
can that is cut to the width of the wheel. It is then
soldered in place and the wheel is made.</p>

<p>If plenty of evaporated milk cans are not handy,
it is better to buy four new, filled cans from the
grocer, as these small cans cost only eight cents
when filled with milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig43">
<img src="images/figure43.jpg" width="300" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Empty the cans by cutting a slit in the side with
a sharp can opener, see <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>. Hold the cans over
a glass or jar until the milk runs out into the glass,
then rinse the cans out with hot water which will
also remove the label. Continue cutting around the
can with the can opener until it is completely cut in
half. All four cans should be emptied and cut in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in this manner. As for the milk, any cook will know
what to do with that.</p>

<p>Open the dividers to ⅜ inch and scribe a line
around the bottom of one of the cans that has been
cut in two, using the soldered edge of the rim against
which to rest one point of the dividers, as shown in
<a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>. Cut away the surplus tin exactly as if you
were making a tray. If the cans have become dented
when they were being cut with the can opener, place
them on a round anvil and remove the dents by
hammering gently with a mallet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig44">
<img src="images/figure44.jpg" width="400" height="135" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Take up another half can and make a cut from
the edge down to the flange at the bottom as shown
in <a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>. Take an old pair of flat-nosed pliers
and hold it over an open flame, such as a gas range
or the flame of a soldering copper heater, until the
solder shows in a bright line at the joint of the can
and lid, then take the forming mallet and give the
lid at the bottom a sharp tap or two with it which
should knock the lid away from the sides of the can
held by the pliers, see <a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>. Do not use your
good pliers to hold the can over the flame, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
heat will soon take the temper out of them and
render them useless.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to get the can red hot in
order to melt the solder.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>When the lid is removed, try to fit it on the
other part of the can and it will be found impossible
to force the tin into the lid without denting the
sides of the can. The rim or flange at the edge of
the lid must be enlarged in order to place the lid
back on the can. The edge of the sides of the can
to be fitted into the lid should be filed with a small
flat file to remove the tin raised by the metal shears
when cutting around the can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>To enlarge the rim of the lid, place it over a
piece of pipe held in a vise and hammer the rim with
a light hammer, turning the lid slowly around on
the anvil as you hammer, see <a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>. After hammering
completely around the flange once or twice,
try to fit the lid to the can again. It should fit without
much hammering. Squeeze the lid on the can
and hammer it gently into place, the wheel being
placed flat on the bench at the time. Solder the lid
in place and the wheel is finished except for the
axle holes.</p>

<p>A small drop of solder will be found on the lid
of all evaporated milk cans. Melt this away with a
hot soldering copper and a round hole will be found
exactly in the center of the lid. This hole may be
enlarged to fit the wire used for the axle.</p>

<p>Find the center of the side of the wheel with the
dividers as described on <a href="#Page_37">page 37, Chapter II</a>.</p>

<p>Use an ice pick to punch a tiny hole exactly in
the center of the wheel. If ⅛-inch galvanized wire
is to be used for an axle, push the ice pick further
into the hole, turning the pick while doing so, until
the hole is just large enough to fit the axle wire.
Repeat the process on the other side of the wheel
until the hole there is enlarged to fit the axle wire,
<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>.</p>

<p>If the axle holes are not exactly in the center of
the wheel, it will not run true. A little care used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
punching the holes will cause it to run true enough
for any toy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;" id="fig47">
<img src="images/figure47.jpg" width="150" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If you possess a hand drill and a drill the same
size of the wire used for an axle, you may drill the
hole in the center of the wheel instead of punching
it through. To do this, first find the center of the
wheel and then make a slight dent exactly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
center of the wheel with the ice pick or a small center
punch. The point of the drill is placed in this dent
when starting to drill the hole. I find it better to
use a ⅟₁₆-inch drill and drill a hole through the
center of the wheel with this first, then use a drill
the same size as the axle wire and enlarge the
⅟₁₆-inch hole with this.</p>

<p>In any case, the wheel should be soldered together
before the holes are put through the centers.
Finish up the four wheels and lay them aside until
the truck is nearly completed, as the wheels are the
last things to be added.</p>

<p>Galvanized wire of ⅛ or ³⁄₁₆ inch diameter is
usually used for axles. This wire is usually carried
in stock at hardware stores. It is usually furnished
in coiled form and must be straightened out before
being used. A piece is cut from the coil of wire
long enough to make the two axles. It should
then be placed on a flat metal surface and
hammered straight.</p>

<p><i>Making Wheels from Rolled-Rim Cans.</i>—A very
strong wheel may be used from rolled-rim cans.
This process is slightly different from that used
with the soldered flange cans. Wheels from 2½ to 6
inches in diameter may be made by this second
method, but unless this type of wheel is made from
very small cans it is not so suitable for the truck as
the wheels made from small evaporated milk cans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight rolled-rim cans will have to be used to
make four wheels unless the cans are opened at the
side when first emptied. Both types of wheels
should be made so as to become familiar with the
making of each type, as both types are used in
making the models shown in this book.</p>

<p>This second type of wheel is rather easier to
make than the first, but
you should know how to
make either type, as then
many different sizes of
wheels may be made with
whatever cans you may
have. The rolled rim is
more often employed in
making large cans than in
the smaller ones.</p>

<p>To make wheels suitable
for a truck of the
size described here, small
soup cans may be used;
these are usually rolled-rim
cans.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;" id="fig48">
<img src="images/figure48.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span></p>
</div>

<p>To make a wheel from two rolled-rim cans, a
line should be scribed about the base of the can, ⅜
inch from the bottom, and the can cut down to this
line, see <a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>, <i>A</i>. Scribe a line ¼ inch from the
base of the second can and cut this can down to this
line. Make a cut every ¼ inch around the tin at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
side of this second can, each cut to reach the base or
rim of the can, see <a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>, <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Place this part of the wheel on the wooden block
and use the riveting hammer (<i>C</i>) to drive the cut
side of the can inward as shown in <a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>, <i>B</i>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Now take up the can cut down to ⅜ inch and
place it over a pipe anvil which is held in the vise.
Use a metal hammer and hammer around the edge
of this can two or three times to enlarge it. Turn
the can around the anvil when hammering it. Then
try to push it down over the second or turned part
of the second can as shown in <a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>, <i>D</i>. If it does
not fit, continue the hammering until the two parts
of the wheel fit together and then solder them in
place and the wheel is completed, except for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
axle holes, which may be put in exactly the same
way as they are put in the first type of wheel.</p>

<p>Be sure to try both methods until you understand
them thoroughly, as a great deal depends on
the ability to make good wheels for a toy model.</p>

<p><i>Two Types of Wheels Made from Can Lids.</i>—A
third method of making wheels is to use two can
lids soldered together, but as it takes quite a while
to collect eight can lids of the same diameter, it is
better to employ this method only occasionally, as
for flanged car wheels made to run on a track, etc.
A glance at <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>, <i>A</i>, should be enough to show
how these wheels are made up of two pushed-in can
lids soldered together at their largest diameter.</p>

<p>The first two methods described result in wheels
that look like the heavy truck wheels employed on
actual trucks.</p>

<p>Another type of wheel may be built of the
flanged pushed-in lids. In this type the lids are
soldered together in just the opposite way as that
described in the third method, so that the flanges
are on the outside of the wheels. These wheels are
generally used for belt wheels on the mechanical
models, <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>, <i>B</i>.</p>

FOR FOLDING</p>

</div>

<p><b>Forming the Chassis.</b>—The chassis or frame of
the truck may be made from a single piece of tin
cut from a gallon fruit can. All four edges are
turned down so as to form a shallow tray or box.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of tin 12¾ by 4¼ inches. Use the
dividers to mark off a line ⅜ of an inch inside all
four sides, but be sure that the tin is cut perfectly
square before you do this inside marking. Cut in
to the lines A A on all four of the darkened lines
as shown in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>, <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>Place the tin on a sharp-edged block and fold
down the long sides 1 and 2 first. Remember not
to try to fold these long sides or folds down all at
once, but rather go over them two or three times
lightly with the mallet as they are being turned
down at a right angle. Take care that the tin folds
over exactly at the line.</p>

<p>When the sides 1 and 2 are folded down at right
angles, fold down the ends 3 and 4. This will leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
four small ends of the two long sides projecting
beyond the ends as shown in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>, <i>B</i>. Fold these
in over the ends of the chassis with a mallet. Hold
them in place with a pair of flat-nosed pliers and
solder them to the ends where they touch, so that
the chassis appears as shown in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p><b>Using the Wooden Roofing Folder.</b>—Folds of
all kinds may be very easily and quickly made by
using the wooden roofing folder, <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a>. The
work turned out by this simple machine is very
straight and true, particularly long folds or angles
of tin. The gauge may be set at any desired width
up to ⁷⁄₁₆ of an inch and any number of folds of the
desired width can be quickly and accurately produced
by inserting the tin between the holding bars and
closing up the folder.</p>

</div>

<p>The folder is shown in <a href="#fig53">Fig. 53</a>. Both of these
views are sectional to show the working of the
folder. The actual construction may be easily understood
by looking at the actual folder. The gauge <i>B</i>,
<a href="#fig52">Fig. 52</a>, is adjusted by first loosening up the five
screws <i>E</i> with a screw driver and then pulling in or
pushing out the gauge <i>B</i> to the desired width of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fold to be made. The screws <i>E</i> are then tightened
up with the screw driver and the tin inserted between
the pieces <i>A A</i>. The folder is then closed by
grasping the handle <i>D</i> and closing the two sides of
the folder together. When the folder is opened, the
tin will be found to be folded over.</p>

<p>The fold may then be completed with the mallet
if it is desired to close it up against the tin. To form
a right angle the folder is
not completely closed. A
little experimenting with
a piece of scrap tin will
show how far to close the
folder in order to obtain a
given angle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;" id="fig53">
<img src="images/figure53.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Care should be taken
to set the gauge <i>B</i> parallel
with the holding bar <i>A</i>.
The folder is ordinarily set at ¼ inch. This is the
width of most of the folds made in the tin. This
simple machine will save much time in tin working
and one should be purchased if possible. It is practically
the only way a long fold in a narrow strip of
tin may be made accurately.</p>

<p>The folder may be used to fold down the two
long sides of the chassis, the ends may then be turned
down over the edge of a block as the ends of the
long folds will prevent placing the short folds in the
folder. Narrow strips of tin may be folded over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and hammered together with the mallet. These
strips of tin may be slipped over the sharp edges at
the bottom of each side of the chassis, thus making
the edges very strong and removing the danger of
cutting the fingers. <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>, <i>D</i>, shows an enlarged
view of a corner of the chassis with the folded tin
strips slipped over the lower edges.</p>

<p>These narrow folded strips are very easily made
on the folding machine. Cut two strips of tin ½ by
12 inches and set the folder to fold ¼ inch, place
the tin in the folder and fold it over. Remove it
from the folder and hammer it nearly together with
the mallet and then place a separate strip of tin in
the folded part and continue hammering with the
mallet until the folded tin is closed in on the inside
or inserted strip of tin.</p>

<p>The folded strip is then ready to slip over the
edge of the side of the chassis and to be soldered to
it in several places; that is, the folded strip need
not be soldered to the chassis continuously, but may
be held in place by soldering about every four inches.</p>

<p>The two short strips of tin ½ by 4 inches should
then be cut, folded and soldered in place at the short
ends of the chassis. (No sharp edge should be left
about a tin can toy when it may be avoided by
folding or covering.)</p>

<p>A long narrow strip of tin is rather difficult to
fold without the use of a folder, but it may be done
with the mallet and block as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Folding.</b>—If a strip of tin ½ by 12 inches is to
be folded over, it is better to cut a strip of tin 1¼
by 12 inches. Mark off ¼ inch all along one long
edge and fold it down over a block as in making the
handle of the cooky cutter, for you will then have
more metal to hold to while folding. When the
piece is completely folded down to a right angle,
turn it over on the block and close the tin down with
a mallet, inserting a piece of tin before closing the
tin together. Then the surplus tin may be cut away
and you have a narrow folded strip. As in all folding
by hand using the mallet and the block, the tin
should be gradually folded into place.</p>

<p><b>Using the Vise for Short Folding.</b>—The vise may
be used to fold short pieces of tin very accurately.
The folding line is first marked on the tin; the tin is
then placed and held in the vise jaws so that the
line is parallel with and exactly at the top of the
jaws. The mallet is then used to hammer the tin
over to the required angle, see <a href="#fig54">Fig. 54</a>. A very
sharp accurate fold should result.</p>

<p><b>Using the Hatchet Stake for Folding.</b>—A special
stake has been devised for folding tin. This is
called the hatchet stake and is listed in the supplementary
tool list. It is made in the shape of the
letter T. The horizontal part is made like a long
narrow-bladed hatchet, and the vertical shank
attached to it may be held in the vise or set in a
hole in the bench, see <a href="#fig55">Fig. 55</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The top edge of this tool is perfectly straight
and fairly sharp. One side of the blade runs
straight down from the edge and the other side
slopes down at an angle considerably less than a
right angle. The top edge of the hatchet stake is
used to fold the tin over and it is specially formed
to permit the folding of more than a right angle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 225px;" id="fig54">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>To use the hatchet stake, a folding line is first
marked on the tin. This line is kept directly over
and parallel with the top or edge of the stake and
the mallet is used to fold the tin, the mallet blows
being directed at the top of the stake as shown
in <a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a>.</p>

<p>The hatchet stake is a very handy tool about
the shop, even if a folder is included in the equipment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as there are some jobs that will not permit
the use of the folder to complete them.</p>

<p>Strips of tin as long as the blade of the hatchet
stake may be accurately folded over as follows:</p>

<p>A strip of maple 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide
and as long as the blade of the stake may be clamped
against the flat side of the blade of the hatchet stake
with the tin to be folded held tightly between the
maple strip and the blade. The mallet is then used
to fold the tin over toward the sloping side of the
blade, <a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a>. Sometimes two strips of maple
may be clamped to a piece of tin to hold it accurately
while being folded, but this method is
rather cumbersome.</p>

at length so that the reader may become
familiar with all of them, but a great deal of folding
may be done over a sharp-edged maple block, if you
have nothing else with which to work.</p>

<p>Professional tinners use a very convenient folding
machine made of metal, but these are very costly
and need not be described here.</p>

<p>MAKING THE HOOD AND RADIATOR—CUTTING THE
VENTS—SOLDERING ON THE FILLER CAP</p>

</div>

<p>The hood and radiator may be made from a
cocoa tin, a small olive oil or cooking oil can, provided
that the can is shaped as shown in <a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>,
which shows the bottom and sides of a cocoa tin.</p>

<p>The can is first cut down to the dotted line <i>A</i>.
Then the can is cut at the dotted line <i>B</i>. Then some
holes are punched in regular rows in the bottom of
the can to produce the radiator. Slits are cut in
the side of the can to form vents and a cap from a
tooth-paste or paint tube is soldered on near the
rolled rim for a filler cap and the hood is complete
as shown in <a href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p>The rectangular can selected for the hood is
marked and cut to shape as follows: Open the
dividers to 2⅝ inches and mark the line <i>A</i> around
the can, <a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>. Before cutting the can down to
this line set the dividers to 2¼ inches and mark the
line <i>B</i> horizontally around the can. To do this, rest
the can flat on the bench and on the side that is to
form the top of the hood. Rest one point of the
dividers on the bench and let the other point rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
against the side of the can where the dotted line <i>B</i>
is indicated. Still holding the can flat on the bench,
move it against the divider point in such a manner
that the line <i>B</i> is scribed horizontally around the
sides and bottom of the can.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 250px;" id="fig58">
<img src="images/figure58.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span></p>

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 275px;" id="fig59">
<img src="images/figure59.jpg" width="275" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Cut the can down to the line <i>A</i>, then take up a
small sharp-cornered file and file completely through
the rolled rim at the corners marked <i>C</i> and <i>C</i> on the
line <i>B</i>. Use the edge of the file and make a triangular
cut. This filing will greatly simplify cutting
the rolled rim which is hard to cut through
with the shears.</p>

<p>Then cut into the rim on the line <i>B</i>, cutting
from the line <i>A</i>. Bend the two halves of the can
open far enough to admit the shears and cut across
the bottom of the can on the dotted line <i>B</i>. Cut very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
carefully so that the part of the can at the line <i>B</i>,
forming the bottom of the hood, will rest flat on the
bench all around. If it rests flat on the bench, it
will rest flat on the tin frame of the truck where it
is to be soldered in place.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to punch the holes to
form the radiator. The front of the hood is rested
on a block of wood and a very sharp punch should
be used for punching the holes, such as an ice pick
or a very sharp-pointed nail.</p>

<p>First mark off the radiator in regular squares,
using the depressed line usually found in the bottom
of this type of can as a boundary line for the squares.
Divide up the space into squares as indicated in Fig.
60, <i>A</i>, leaving a clear border of tin all around the
space to be punched.</p>

<p>Find a block of wood that will fit inside the
hood as shown in <a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>, <i>C</i>, and place one end of
this in the vise. See that the end is sawn off square
before placing the hood over it in the position shown.</p>

<p>Take up the punch and carefully punch the holes
as they are marked by the dots in <a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>, <i>A</i>, at each
line intersection. Then punch a hole in the center
of each square and then a hole should be punched
between every other hole on all the lines forming the
squares, see <a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>, <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to punch all the holes of
the same size and to get them in regular rows.
This makes a neat and workman-like job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cutting the Vents.</b>—Vents may be cut in each
side of the hood with a sharp chisel. An old wood
or carpenter’s chisel about an inch wide will do very
well or a sharp cold chisel may be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;" id="fig60">
<img src="images/figure60.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Use the same wooden block that you used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
punch out the radiator on and place it horizontally
in the vise jaws so that enough of it projects beyond
them to support the hood as shown in <a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;" id="fig61">
<img src="images/figure61.jpg" width="375" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Use the dividers to mark off four or five vents
and see to it that they are laid out square with the
hood. Try to find a chisel that is as wide as the
vent is long, a 1-inch cutting edge is about right.
Place the edge of the chisel squarely on the mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and hammer it through the tin with several blows
from the mallet. Make these cuts very straight and
parallel with each other. Cut the vents in both sides
of the hood and the hood is then ready to have the
filler cap soldered on.</p>

<p><b>Soldering on the Filler Cap.</b>—Use a large sized
screw cap of a tooth-paste tube or the cap from a
paste or paint tube for the filler cap. Some of these
caps are octagonal in shape and have various initials
stamped on the top and these look very much like the
filler caps used on the radiators of real automobiles.</p>

<p>Clean away all paste or paint from the inside
of the cap and then scrape the lower edge bright and
clean. These caps are usually made of a combination
of metals that is very much like the solder used
for soldering tin and they will melt very easily if
brought in contact with a soldering copper, so that
the cap must be soldered to the hood by an indirect
heating method.</p>

<p>Soldering paste is first applied to the top of the
hood where the cap is to be soldered and then a small
puddle of solder is applied to the tin at this place
with a hot soldering copper. The solder is allowed
to cool and then the cap is placed in position on the
solder after applying a bit of soldering paste to
its lower edge.</p>

<p>Heat the soldering copper very hot and apply
it <em>inside</em> the hood so that as much of the point as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
possible rests <em>directly under the puddle of solder on
which the cap rests</em>, <a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig62">
<img src="images/figure62.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Hold it in this position until the puddle of solder
melts and a bright line of solder is seen to run around
the base of the cap where it rests on the hood. Remove
the copper just as soon as the solder melts and
runs around the cap and let the solder harden before
moving the hood about. If the cap moves out of
place while the solder is molten, owing to the bubbling
of the soldering paste, it may immediately be
pushed back into place with a matchstick before the
solder hardens.</p>

<p>The hood will become very hot before the solder
melts under the cap, but it may be easily held to
the bench by wrapping a rag around it to protect
the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>A thick square bar of iron may be heated to a
dull red at the end and used in place of the soldering
copper for soldering on the cap. Either the copper
or the bar of iron must be very hot. They must be
heated to a much greater temperature than ordinarily
used for soldering.</p>

<p>When the filler cap is soldered in place the hood
is ready to be soldered to the frame, but the dash-board
and seat should be made before this is done.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Dash-Board.</b>—The dash-board is the next
thing to be made, and then the seat. The hood, dash-board
and seat are then soldered to the frame. Four
imitation springs are then made and soldered to
the bottom of the frame; holes are punched in these
for axles; the wheels and axles are put in place, and
the chassis of the truck is finished.</p>

<p>The dash-board may be formed in two ways; one
way is to use part of a rolled-rim can, the rolled
rim forming the top, and the other way is to fold
over three edges of a piece of tin and form this into
a dash-board. The first method looks better, but
the last method is easier.</p>

<p>Select a large rolled-rim can, measure off 5¼
inches along the rolled rim and from each end of
this measurement, run a line 2¼ inches down the
side of the can. Then mark a line around the can
2½ inches down from the rolled rim and cut the
can down to this line exactly as you would cut a can
down to any line, see <a href="#fig63">Fig. 63</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Then cut out the piece 2½ by 5¼ inches including
the rim. Use the flat-nosed pliers and break
away the tin next the rim where the can was first
opened with the can opener, just as you did when
making a pail. Hammer down any tin left next
the rim and then place the piece of tin on the bench

<i>B</i> and <i>C</i> to give a rounded edge to the sides of the
dash-board, as shown in <a href="#fig65">Fig. 65</a>.</p>

<p>Place a piece of round bar iron or a pipe about 1
inch in diameter in the vise and round over each end
of the dash-board so that the folded edges are inside
as shown in <a href="#fig65">Fig. 65</a>, and then round over the ends
of the rolled rim with a flat file to make them smooth
and the dash-board is finished.</p>

<p>To make a dash-board out of a flat piece of tin,
cut out a piece 2¾ by 5¼ inches. Set the dividers
to ¼ inch and scribe a line ¼ inch inside three edges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the piece. Cut off two corners at the top and fold
in the flaps to the dotted line as shown in <a href="#fig66">Fig. 66</a>.
Round over the ends of the dash-board as described
above and to the same dimensions.</p>

<p><b>The Seat.</b>—A very simple seat may be made for
the truck out of three pieces of tin. Use a piece of
tin with the rolled rim at the top as in making the
dash-board. Cut a piece of tin 3¼ by 3½ inches,
fold in two of the sides exactly as you did for the
dash-board and cut off the rolled rim until it is even
with the sides after turning and round over the
ends of the rolled rim with a file.</p>

<p>Use the dividers to mark two lines parallel with the
rolled rim, one line 1 inch in and the other 2⅛ inches
as shown in <a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a> by the dotted lines. Bend the
piece over a block as shown until it is shaped like
the seat shown in <a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of tin 1⅜ by 1¼ inches. Mark
a line ¼ inch in from the ends of one of the short
sides of each piece and bend this part at right angles,
<a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>, <i>A</i>. These two pieces are to be slipped under
each end of the seat and soldered to it and then
trimmed off with the shears until the whole bottom
edge of the seat rests flat on the frame where it is
to be soldered.</p>

<p>The two side pieces or supports are made too
long purposely so that they may be trimmed off
after they are soldered to the seat. The hood, dash-board
and seat should be soldered in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Assembling the Truck.</b>—Set the dividers to ¼
inch and scribe a line ¼ inch in from the front end
of the frame. Place the front of the hood parallel
with this line and see that the hood is set exactly
in the middle of the frame; that it is set at the same
distance from the side of the hood to the side of the
frame on each side. Solder the hood in place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;" id="fig68">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>When soldering the hood to the frame, it is
better to rest the frame on a block of wood so that
the block supports the frame that is directly under
the hood when soldering the hood to the frame.</p>

<p>The block will prevent the tin from bulging
down from the heat of the copper and from the pressure
of the hand when holding the hood in place
to solder it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Set the dash-board in place back of the hood and
see that it fits snugly in place against the hood and
also the frame and then solder it in place. If every
joint is made to fit snugly before attempting to
solder it, no trouble should be experienced, but sometimes
a crack will develop owing to the expansion of
the tin under heat of the soldering copper. These
cracks may be filled in with solder by feeding a strip
of solder against the point of the hot copper when
soldering. This causes a lot of solder to run into
the crack and fill it.</p>

<p>Solder the seat in position so that the front of the
seat is about 1 inch from the ends of the dash-board.</p>

<p><b>Springs.</b>—Holes may be punched through the
sides of the frame and the axles run through them
if a very simple truck is to be made, but imitation
springs may be easily made from part of the sides
and bottom of a can. These springs raise the frame
of the truck above the axles and give it a more
realistic appearance.</p>

<p>Cut two three-inch cans down to ⅜ inch in
height. Turn these cans bottom up and place the
ruler across the rim of each can bottom in turn in
such a way as to measure 2½ inches from rim to
rim. Then measure off another 2½ inches on each
rim as shown in <a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a>. File through the rims at
<i>A A</i> and then cut straight down the sides of the can
at <i>A A A</i> which should give you three springs from
each can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Solder two springs to the bottom and side of the
frame ½ inch from the front end and the two
rear springs should be soldered 1 inch in from the
back end.</p>

<p>Use an ice pick to punch a hole in each spring to
receive the axle and be sure that these holes are all
the same distance from the top of the frame (use
the dividers to determine this), and also that each
hole is square across from the opposite axle hole
(use the try square to determine this).</p>

<p>The axle holes should be punched through with
an ice pick and be made somewhat larger than the
axle wire so that the axle wire fits very loosely in
the hole, but be sure to have all the holes the same size.</p>

<p><b>Soldering the Wheels on the Axles.</b>—The wire
axles should be cut long enough to go entirely
through each wheel and across the frame and to
allow a distance of ¼ inch between the frame of
the truck and each wheel. The length of the axles
may be easily determined by placing the frame of
the truck flat on the bench and placing the two
wheels in position, each wheel to stand out ¼ inch
from the side of the truck. Measure the distance
with a ruler from the outer edge of one wheel to
the outer edge of the other and add ⅛ inch to this
distance, see <a href="#fig70">Fig. 70</a>. Cut the two wire axles to
this measurement and see that they are perfectly
straight after cutting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Place one end of an axle through a wheel until
the end of it projects beyond the outside of the
wheel about ⅟₁₆ of an inch. Put some soldering
paste on the end of the axle and on the wheel next
to the axle and use a well-heated soldering copper
to solder the wheel to the axle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 250px;" id="fig70">
<img src="images/figure70.jpg" width="250" height="180" alt="" />

<img src="images/figure71.jpg" width="225" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>To do this, place the wheel flat on the edge of
the bench so that the axle hole is just over the edge
and so that the axle may be held against the side
of the bench. Hold the wheel and axle firmly in
this position and lay the hot soldering copper, well
charged with solder, on the end of the axle wire
just above the wheel.</p>

<p>The end of the axle will heat up very quickly and
the solder should run down and form a puddle about
the axle when that part of the wheel next the axle
is heated up to the flowing point of the solder. The
end of the axle should not project more than
⅟₁₆ inch beyond the wheel and the soldering copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
should be heated thoroughly and be well charged
with solder, see <a href="#fig71">Fig. 71</a>.</p>

<p>The wheels need only be soldered to the axle on
one side of each wheel if the holes for the axle fit
it very snugly.</p>

<p>Another method of holding the wheel in position
on the axle while being soldered is to drill a hole
exactly the same size as the axle through a fairly
thick block of wood and to push the axle through
this hole until just enough of it projects so that when
the wheel is slipped over it ⅟₁₆ inch of the axle will
project beyond the wheel. The wooden block may
then be placed in the vise and the wheel slipped over
the axle and soldered to it. The hole drilled through
the block must be drilled at right angles to the face
of the block where the wheel is to rest. A hole may
be drilled at right angles to a wood or metal surface
by using a bench or post drill if you have one.
Wheels may be set on the axle very accurately by
this last method.</p>

<p>When one wheel is soldered to each axle lay
them aside and make some washers for the axles
before the two remaining wheels are soldered on.
These washers are placed on the axles between the
frame and each wheel to keep the wheels from running
against the truck.</p>

<p><b>Strip Washers.</b>—These washers may be made
from narrow strips of tin wound around the axles
like a tightly coiled clock spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut a strip of tin ³⁄₁₆ of an inch wide and 8
inches long. Take a pair of round-nosed pliers and
bend one end over at a sharp curve that fits about
the axle wire. Hold the curved part of the tin to
the axle with the flat-nosed pliers and wind the tin
around the wire in a right coil taking fresh grip on
the tin strip with the pliers each time the tin is
wound around. Wind the tin about the axle four
times and then cut the remaining tin away and use
it to make the other three washers, see <a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Slip one washer on one of the axles next to one
of the wheels soldered to it; then push the axle
through the axle holes in the springs and then place
another washer on it before placing another or second
wheel on the axle.</p>

<p>The washers are not soldered in place but simply
left loose on the axle.</p>

<p>The second wheel is placed on the axle and soldered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to it as the first wheel was. The truck may
be placed on its side to bring the second wheel into a
convenient position for soldering. Be sure that the
axle turns easily in the axle holes and that there is
plenty of room for the washers between the sides
of the frame and the wheel before soldering the
second wheel in place. The second wheel may be
soldered on the second axle in the same way and
then the chassis is finished and ready to run, see
<a href="#fig73">Fig. 73</a>.</p>

<p>Various bodies may be placed on the rear of the
chassis and a steering wheel, crank and lights may
be added when it is thus far successfully completed,
and these will be described in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged if you have managed to
get more solder about the truck than seems necessary,
as it may be scraped away as described in
<a href="#Page_200">Chapter XXI, page 200</a>.</p>

<p>TRUCK BODIES—DIFFERENT TYPES OF BODIES TO BE
FITTED TO THE SAME CHASSIS—THE TANK TRUCK—THE
STREET SPRINKLER—THE COAL OR SAND
TRUCK—THE ARMY TRUCK—THE AMBULANCE—THE
FIRE ENGINE</p>

</div>

<p>A permanent body of a certain type may be
soldered directly to the rear part of the chassis or
slides may be soldered to the rear part of the chassis
and different types of truck bodies arranged to fit
into these slides so that one chassis may be arranged
to hold a number of different bodies. A coal truck
may be transformed into a tank truck and from a
tank truck into an army truck or an ambulance, etc.</p>

<p>A driver’s cab may be fitted over the seat and
any number of realistic details added to the truck,
limited only by the ability of the maker.</p>

<p>The wagon body is the simplest to make, as it
may be made from a square can with rounded corners.
The two quart or gallon cans that have contained
olive or cooking oils make up into very
realistic truck bodies. The body of the army truck
shown in the frontispiece was made from a two-quart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
can that had contained a cooking oil of a
very well-known brand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;" id="fig74">
<img src="images/figure74.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The object is to find a rectangular can that is
just about the width of the chassis so that the tops
of the wheels will clear it nicely. Cut the can in two
lengthwise, using the file to cut through the rounded
or rolled rims, see <a href="#fig74">Fig. 74</a>, <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>The can will probably be too long for a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
proportioned body and will have to be cut down to a
suitable length, about 7 inches. Truck bodies usually
overhang the chassis. Study some of the big
trucks seen on the streets, as some of them are
remarkably easy to reproduce.</p>

<p>If the can has to be shortened, use a can opener
or the double cutting shears and cut around the can
1 inch from either end until one end of the can is
completely cut away, then cut the shorter end down
to ¼ inch at the side, leaving that much of the side
of the can so that it may be slipped inside the other
or larger part of the can when that part of the can
is cut down to a suitable length, when the shorter
end is soldered in place to form the end of the body,
see <a href="#fig74">Fig. 74</a>, <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>When one end is cut off the can, cut the can
in two lengthwise so that the part to be used is about
1½ inches high, and then cut off the shorter end so
that it is also 1½ inches high to correspond to the
other part of the body. Then fit in the end of the
can and solder it in place.</p>

<p>Cut four strips of tin ½ inch in width, two of
them as long as the two sides of the can and two
as long as the ends and fold these strips over to
make a protection for the top edges of the body just
as you did for the lower edges of the chassis. Solder
these strips in place and the body is finished and
ready to be soldered to the truck, see <a href="#fig74">Fig. 74</a>, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Different Types of Bodies to be Fitted to the
Same Chassis.</b>—The body described above may be
soldered directly to the chassis of the truck or to a
strip of tin and so arranged as to slide onto the
chassis between two slides made of folded tin. These
slides are soldered directly to the chassis in the rear
of the seat and the different types of bodies arranged
to fit between them, thus using the same chassis
for as many different types of bodies as one cares
to make for it.</p>

<p>The fixed slides should be made of two ½-inch
strips of tin as long as the back or floor of the
chassis, about 6 inches. These strips are folded
over into a gutter shape as are the strips used to
protect the bottom edge of the truck frame, but the
folded strips used for the slides are left somewhat
more open, about ⅛ inch between the edges, so
that when soldered to the truck a strip of tin may
be easily slipped between them as shown in <a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>.</p>

<p>A flat strip of tin should be cut as long as the
two slides and of such a width that it will fit easily
into the slides soldered to the truck to receive it.
Care should be used when soldering the slides to the
truck to get them parallel with the sides of the
frame and also parallel with each other as shown
in <a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>.</p>

<p>Several cross-members may be made of folded
tin and may be soldered to the flat piece of tin that
is to slide between the slides. The truck body should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
be soldered to these cross-members so that the body
will clear the fixed slides when slipped into place.</p>

<p>These cross-members or body supports are usually
found under the bodies of large trucks and they
add a very realistic touch to the model. They should
be just long enough to clear the edges of the fixed
slides when attached to the flat strip of tin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig75">
<img src="images/figure75.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Cut three pieces of tin 1¼ inches wide and long
enough to make the cross-members, about 3 inches
(make sure of this measurement for yourself).
Scribe a line ⅜ inch in from each of the long sides
of the three pieces and then fold down two sides of
each piece from the scribed lines, making three cross-members
or supports as shown in <a href="#fig76">Fig. 76</a>. Solder
these to the flat strip of tin that is to fit between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the fixed slides. The truck body should be soldered
to these three supports.</p>

<p>A round can with the lid soldered on will make a
very satisfactory tank truck. A part of a small can,
such as a tooth powder can, may be soldered to the
top of the tank for a filler dome and imitation
faucets made of wire or of brass cup hooks may be
soldered to the rear of the tank and a small delivery
can may easily be made and hung on the faucets as
shown in <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>.</p>

<p>Six different types of truck bodies that may be
attached to the chassis are shown in <a href="#fig77">Fig. 77</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Tank Truck.</b>—The tank truck is made from
a rectangular cooking oil can with a part of a small
can soldered to the top. The faucets are made of
pieces of galvanized wire bent over at an angle.</p>

<p><b>The Street Sprinkler.</b>—The street sprinkler may
be made from a large round can, such as a molasses
or syrup can with the lid soldered on to make it
water tight. A hole is cut in the top of the can and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the top, or open end, of a small soup can is soldered
over the hole. The sprinkler tubes are made of
strips of tin rolled around a large nail and then
soldered together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The sprinkler ends are made of small round
metal boxes with tiny holes punched in the under
side. A hole is punched in the top of each round
box and the sprinkler ends are soldered to the tubes
and the tubes soldered to the tank which has holes
punched in it to admit water to the tubes in such a
way that the water contained in the tank will flow
from the tank into the tubes and out of the sprinkler
holes punched in the small boxes. These small boxes
or sprinkler ends may be made of thumb tack boxes
or from two bottle caps soldered together, but the
crinkled part should be cut away from the bottle
caps before soldering.</p>

<p><b>The Coal or Sand Truck.</b>—The coal or sand truck
body is made of less than half of a rectangular cooking
oil can, the top of each side flared out and extra
pieces fitted to each end so as to fit into the flaring
sides and to each end. All sharp edges should be
folded over or extra folded strips of tin folded over
and placed over the edges of the truck body.</p>

<p><b>The Army Truck.</b>—The army truck body is
made from part of a cooking oil can. Galvanized
wire of small diameter is bent into hoop form and
soldered to the sides. These hoops may be covered
with a khaki-colored cloth like the one shown
on the large army truck in frontispiece; a khaki-colored
handkerchief will make an excellent cover
for a small truck.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Ambulance.</b>—The ambulance body may be
made from a large cooking oil can. Both ends are
cut out of the can and the extra tin trimmed away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
One side of the can is cut off and a flat piece of tin
soldered across the open side of the can to form
the floor of the ambulance. A hood to cover the
driver’s seat is made from the curved side of the
can cut away to form the floor of the body. Two
strips of tin may be soldered to the side of the body
to form seats or stretchers and two pieces of galvanized
wire may be soldered to the seats and to the
floor and roof of the body to form handles. The
rear step may be made of a piece of folded tin and
two pieces of galvanized wire as shown. A realistic
touch may be given to the ambulance by making a
small curtain of carriage leather and attaching it to
the rear of the roof so that it may be rolled up
and fastened in place.</p>

<p><b>The Fire Engine.</b>—The fire engine boiler may
be made from a tomato can with several different
sized can lids soldered to the bottom to form the
smoke hood and a cylinder of tin soldered to the
lids to form a chimney. The flaring top of the
chimney may be made of the small center lid sometimes
found in the ends of round cans. This small
lid or sealer may be melted off, the center cut out of
it, and then may be soldered to the top of the chimney.
The steam gauge and water gauge may be
made of the screw tops of cooking oil cans. The

boiler. The rivets may be held in place while soldering
by a pair of pliers.</p>

<p>The boiler platform may be made of a sardine
can. The engine and pump cylinders may be made
of adhesive tape boxes or strips of tin rolled into
cylindrical form and ends soldered in place. The
engine wheel may be made from an evaporated milk

<p>THE STARTING CRANK—THE STEERING WHEEL AND
COLUMN—MUD GUARDS AND RUNNING BOARDS—LIGHTS,
TOOL BOXES, HORNS, ETC.—DRIVERS’ CABS</p>

</div>

<p>Various fittings may be added to the truck and
these add very much to the general appearance and
make the truck very realistic.</p>

<p><b>The Starting Crank.</b>—A starting crank may be
made of a piece of galvanized wire bent into a
crank shape and placed in position through holes
punched for it in front of the frame and through
an extra piece soldered underneath the frame.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of galvanized wire about 5 inches in
length. Fairly heavy wire will look better than thin
wire when made up into a crank. Mark off 1 inch
from one end of the wire and then make another
mark 1 inch in from this one. Place the wire in the
vise jaws so that the first mark is parallel with the
top of the jaws. Use a hammer to bend the wire
over at right angles, then move the wire up to the
second mark and bend the wire again at right angles
so as to produce a crank form as shown in <a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Use an ice pick to punch a hole in the front of the
truck frame and make it large enough so that the
crank will turn in it freely.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of tin ¾ by ¾ inches and bend over
¼ inch at one end and punch a hole to fit the crank
wire in the center of the largest side of this piece
and solder it in position directly back of the hole
punched in the front of the frame and in such a
position that the end of the crank wire projects
about ¼ inch beyond the small angle piece soldered
to the frame, as shown in <a href="#fig80">Fig. 80</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Wind a narrow strip of tin about the straight
projecting end of the crank wire and solder it in
place, the solder being applied to the end of the wire
and to the end of the coiled strip of tin at the same
time, <a href="#fig81">Fig. 81</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Steering Wheel and Column.</b>—A steering
wheel may be made of an old clock gear wheel with
the teeth cut off, or a small can lid may be used
instead. The steering wheel column may be made
of a piece of heavy galvanized wire.</p>

<p>Clock gear wheels are usually fastened to a short
steel shaft, but they may be easily driven off the
shaft by placing the shaft of the wheel in the vise
jaws so that the wheel is above the vise jaws, and
then a few light hammer blows directed at the upper
end of the shaft will loosen the wheel and it may
be easily removed. The vise jaws should hold
the shaft very loosely as it is being driven out of
the wheel.</p>

<p>Use the metal shears to cut off the gear teeth
and a smooth flat file to file down the roughness left
at the edge of the wheel.</p>

<p>Find a piece of galvanized wire that fits into the
hole in the clock wheel or file a larger piece down
until it does fit. The wire should project slightly
beyond the wheel and be soldered to it in exactly
the same manner as the tin can wheel is soldered
to an axle. The wire that the steering gear is
soldered to should be long enough to go through the
dash-board, hood and frame, if the wheel is to turn.
A strip of tin is coiled about the wire below the
frame as shown in <a href="#fig82">Fig. 82</a>. These are soldered in
place to the wire to keep it in position and yet allow
it to turn freely in the holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mud Guards and Running Boards.</b>—Mud guards
may be made from a part of the side and bottom of
a can as shown in <a href="#fig83">Fig. 83</a>. A 3-inch can is the best
size to use for the truck. The can is cut down to a
height of 1⅛ inches and then cut into two parts
across the bottom so that two mud guards may be
made from each can. The outer edges are turned
as in making a tray and folded pieces are slipped
over the ends as shown in <a href="#fig83">Fig. 83</a>. These mud guards
are soldered to the frame in the position shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig82">
<img src="images/figure82.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Running boards may be made of two pieces of
tin, each piece to be cut 1¼ inches wide and as long
as it is desired. The four pieces are each turned
down ⅛ inch at the long sides and two pieces are
fitted over each other to make one running board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
as shown in <a href="#fig84">Fig. 84</a>. Two or three supports may be
made of galvanized wire for the running boards.
These supports extend across the frame of the truck
and one end of each support is soldered to each running
board. One end of each running board is usually
soldered to each mud guard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig83">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Lights, Horns, etc.</b>—Headlights may be made of
thumb tack boxes, bottle caps or the tops of tooth
powder cans. Sidelights may be made from the
screw caps of cooking oil cans or the cylindrical part
of tooth powder can tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Tail-lights may be made of the screw caps of
cooking oil cans.</p>

<p>Searchlights may be made of the smallest size
adhesive tape boxes mounted on suitable standards
made of galvanized wire or strips of tin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="fig84">
<img src="images/figure84.jpg" width="250" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The central part of the cover of these boxes is
cut away and a piece of isinglass or transparent
celluloid may be fitted in to look like a lens. The
central part is cut away by using a small chisel to
cut with when the cover is placed over the end of a
round stick held in the vise. The rough edges are
smoothed away by using a smooth half-round file.</p>

<p>The construction of these lights is so simple as
to need no further explanation and they are simply
soldered to the frame or hood where they touch it
when placed in position. The searchlight is usually
mounted by punching a hole for the standard in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
cowl, or by soldering on an extra piece to the dash
to receive the wire standard, <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig85">

</div>

<p><b>Tool Boxes, Horns, etc.</b>—Small rectangular beef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cube or chewing gum boxes may be soldered to the
running board for tool boxes. These boxes have
rounded corners and look very much like the large
tool boxes, <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig86">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Horns may be made in several ways, the simplest
form being a piece of tin rolled into a cone shape
and soldered to the dash. A more realistic horn may
be made by soldering a screw cap to the larger end
of the cone and adding the cap of a paint tube to the
smaller end. A hand horn may be made as shown
in <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>.</p>

<p>Speedometers, voltmeters and ammeters may be
made of screw tops soldered inside the dash as shown.</p>

<p><b>Drivers’ Cabs.</b>—Most of the large trucks have
some kind of a cab to protect the driver from the
weather, excepting the army trucks, which usually
depend on part of the canvas hood or cover for
protection.</p>

<p>On the toy trucks these cabs may be very simply
made from a square tin cocoa or olive oil can or they
may be more elaborately built, depending on the
ability of the maker. These cabs should be carefully
made and kept in proportion to the rest of the truck.</p>

<p>All sharp edges should be turned over or bound
with folded strips of tin. Windows may be cut in
the cab by placing it on the block and using a small
chisel to cut them out. The edges of these windows
should all be bound with folded strips of tin as
shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>The buggy top for the driver’s seat may be made
from part of a certain well-known curved tobacco
box and several short pieces of galvanized wire,
<a href="#fig86">Fig. 86</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>THE ROWBOAT—THE SAILBOAT—THE SCOW—THE
TUGBOAT—THE BATTLESHIP—THE FERRY-BOAT</p>

</div>

<p>The elliptically shaped tin cans, used for fish of
different kinds, may be made up into boats that will
float. A deck is soldered tightly to the can where
the lid has been removed and various superstructures
added to make the different types of boats, but
to form a rowboat, seats may be soldered to an
open can.</p>

<p><b>The Rowboat.</b>—The rowboat is the simplest
one to make as no deck is to be soldered on. A
narrow elliptical fish can should be used. These
cans usually contain fresh mackerel, and are of
real boat shape.</p>

<p>Such cans are opened at the top inside the rolled
rim. The extra tin near the edge of rim should be
broken away with the pliers as in making a pail, all
roughness being filed away.</p>

<p>Lay the can face down on a sheet of paper, drawing
around the outside edge with a sharp pencil to
get an outline of the boat. This outline will serve
as a guide when cutting out the seats. The seats
may be cut to the outline of the boat already traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on paper, when the two end seats will fit bow and
stern. But the center seat will have to be trimmed
off a bit to fit the boat. The free edges of the seats
must be turned down as a finish.</p>

<p><b>The Sailboat.</b>—A catboat or sloop may be made
from the same sort of narrow elliptical can or even
of a wider can of the same shape. A deck is soldered
to this can, a hole cut in it for a cockpit. To the
edge of the cockpit a folded band of tin is soldered.</p>

<p>A tube of tin is soldered to the stern, and a wire
tiller is run through this tube and soldered to a
rudder. A hole is punched in the center of the forward
deck, and a tube of tin is soldered in this hole
to contain the mast. The mast and spars are of wood.</p>

<p>The keel is made of a piece of tin soldered to
the bottom of the boat. The boat should be completed,
and the mast, spars and sails in place, before
the keel is put on. Try the boat in a basin of water.
It will probably tip over unless a very broad can is
used to make it. Cut out a keel of the shape shown
in <a href="#fig87">Fig. 87</a> and solder it lightly in place at each end.
Place the boat in the water again to see how it floats.
If the keel is too heavy, part of it may be cut off, if
it is too light, it may be broken away and a heavier
one made and soldered on. When properly made
these boats are good sailers.</p>

<p>When soldering a deck to the boat, the rough
edge remaining after cutting away the lid of the
can is left in place so as to form a sort of ledge to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
solder the deck to. The rough flutings may be
flattened out by using a pair of flat-nosed pliers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
press down the flutes as you work along and simply
pinching it flat.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Scow.</b>—A small scow may be made from a
biscuit box of flat tin, the kind that has contained
small sweet biscuits with a cream filling. Both box
and lid are used and cut down as indicated in <a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>.
The box is left at the original width. The two ends
are cut away from the lid. The two folded-down
sides of the lid are used to make folded strips with
which to bind the sides of the scow.</p>

<p>A tiny box made of part of the lid is soldered to
the rear deck of the scow for a cabin. A small piece
of galvanized wire bent at an angle is soldered to
the cabin for a stovepipe. The towing bits are rivets
soldered to the forward deck.</p>

<p><b>The Tugboat.</b>—Tugboats may be made from the
larger elliptical fish cans. A good sized can of this
sort is that one commonly found to contain kippered
herring. This can will make up into a large tugboat,
but if a small tug is to be made to tow the scow
previously described, a mackerel roe can is the
best to use.</p>

<p>A deck is soldered tightly to the can, as in making
the sailboat, except that the deck is left whole;
no openings are cut in it.</p>

<p>The cabin is made from a rectangular cocoa can,
or a small olive oil can, cut down to a suitable height
and soldered to the deck, bottom up.</p>

<p>The pilot house is made from a small adhesive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
plaster box, the smokestack being from a small piece
of tin with top edge first folded over and then rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
into a cylindrical shape. A piece of wire may be
soldered to the stack for an exhaust pipe. A tiny
piece of wire is soldered to the front of the stack for
a whistle. These pieces of wire may be tied to the
stack with fine iron binding wire, such as florists
use. When the wire exhaust and whistle are soldered
to the stack the wire may then be removed. It will
be found very difficult to solder these short pieces
in place without binding them in position.</p>

<p class="caption">Boats made by author</p>

</div>

<p>The lifeboat is made from a small folded piece
of tin, both ends being pushed in and soldered together.
The finished boat is soldered to the roof
of the cabin.</p>

<p>The towing bits are rivets soldered to the deck.
Remember to use the pliers to hold the rivets in
place when soldering them on. When these boats
are floated in the water they may be found to tip to
one side slightly. A bit of solder may be melted on
to the bottom of the boat with the copper in such a
position that it will counteract any tendency to tip.</p>

<p><b>The Battleship, Destroyers, etc.</b>—The battleship
shown in <a href="#plate15">Plate XV</a> is made from a narrow elliptical
fish can. A deck is soldered on and a cabin made of
a small rectangular box such as beef cubes usually
are packed in.</p>

<p>The turrets are made of pill or salve boxes of
small round tin design. The lid of the box is soldered
to the deck and when the box is set in the lid
the turret may be turned about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The guns are made of short pieces of wire
soldered to the turrets and cabin.</p>

<p>The mast is made of a tin oil can spout or a
piece of tin rolled into a cone shape. A screw cap of
a tooth paste tube is soldered to it for a fighting top.</p>

<p>Some sort of a keel will have to be soldered to
the battleship to keep it upright in the water. Three
pieces of heavy galvanized wire may be soldered to
the bottom, one in the center and one at each side, or
a strip of sheet lead may be soldered to the bottom.</p>

<p>A destroyer may be built up in the same manner
as the battleship; in fact, almost any type of
boat may be built by changing the superstructure.</p>

<p><b>The Ferry-boat.</b>—A ferry-boat may be built with
paddle wheels that will revolve when the boat is
pulled along in the water or anchored in a running
stream.</p>

<p>The hull is made from a kippered herring can
with a deck soldered on. Four strips of tin are cut
for the sides of the cabins. Two of these are
soldered to the sides of the hull next to the rolled
rim and following the outline of the can or hull.
The two inside walls of the cabins are soldered about
¾ of an inch inside the outer walls which leaves a
gangway through the center of the boat.</p>

<p>An upper deck is soldered to these four walls;
the inner walls need only be soldered to the upper
deck at each end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The two pilot houses are made of adhesive
plaster boxes and the smokestack is rolled up from
a piece of tin.</p>

<p>A hole is punched or drilled through all four
walls of the cabin to receive the axle of the
paddle wheels.</p>

<p>The paddle wheels are made from small cans
exactly in the same way as the auto truck wheels
and eight small square pieces of tin are soldered to
the circumference of each wheel for paddles. Rolled
strips of tin are placed on the axles between the
wheels and the cabins for washers. The axle should
revolve very freely in the axle holes.</p>

<p>If one has some mechanical ability it is not very
difficult to form a crank in the paddle wheel axle and
attach a connecting rod to a small tin walking beam
which will move up and down as the paddle wheels
revolve. An imitation piston rod may be fastened
to the other end of the walking beam and allowed
to run free through a hole in the upper deck.</p>

<p>The wheels of the ferry-boat will revolve if it
is anchored in a running stream or towed behind
a rowboat.</p>

locomotive is pulled along. The principal dimensions
are given in <a href="#fig89">Fig. 89</a>. This locomotive is not
much more difficult to make than the auto truck, but
it should not be attempted until the auto truck is
satisfactorily completed.</p>

<p><b>The Frame.</b>—The frame of the locomotive should
be made first, and it is made from a flat piece of tin
5¼ by 10½ inches. Scribe a line ¼ inch inside and
along all edges, cut off the corners as shown in
<a href="#fig89">Fig. 89</a> and fold all four edges in. Cut into the corners

<p><b>The Boiler.</b>—The boiler is made of two small
soup cans. One whole can is used and the bottom
and part of the sides of another can of exactly the
same size is soldered to the first can to make a long
boiler. One long can, if obtainable, may be used
for the boiler. When two or more cans are soldered
together to make a long boiler the two rolled rims
of the cans soldered together give the appearance of
a boiler strap as shown in <a href="#fig89">Fig. 89</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Cab.</b>—The cab is made of a rectangular
cocoa can. Most of one side is cut away leaving just
enough to fold back against the sides of the cab.
The cab is then placed on a wooden block and a
chisel is used to cut the window openings. A large
round punch may be used to cut out the front windows
or a very small chisel made of a nail may be
used to cut these circular windows.</p>

<p>A top is made for the cab from a piece of tin
3¾ by 3¾ inches square. One-quarter inch is
marked off and turned in all around this piece. Two
opposite sides are folded down and the two other
sides are left standing at right angles to the piece and
these two opposite sides are left open just enough
to slide over the top of box forming the cab where
the top is soldered in place as shown in the drawing.</p>

<p>The boiler should be soldered to the cab and then
these two are soldered to the frame where they
touch it at the front end of the boiler and the base
of the cab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Wheels.</b>—The front wheels of the locomotive
are made of the small sized evaporated milk cans
exactly in the same way that the wheels of the auto
truck are made. These wheels are 2½ inches in
diameter and ⅝ inch wide.</p>

<p>The wire axle of the front wheels passes through
two lugs that are soldered to the sides of the frame.</p>

<p>The driving wheels are made from 3½-inch
rolled-rim cans. The axle for these wheels passes
directly through holes in the sides of the frame.</p>

<p>A piece of galvanized wire 1¼ inches in length
is used for driving pins for the connecting rods on
each driving wheel. Each piece of wire is placed
through two holes in the driving wheel, these holes
being directly opposite each other and exactly ½
inch from the center of each wheel. As these driving
pins pass entirely through the wheel they should
be soldered to each side of it in order to give added
strength, as they would break away from the wheels
very easily if they did not pass entirely through the
wheel and were not supported by each side of it.</p>

<p><b>Cylinders and Connecting Rods.</b>—These cylinders
are rolled up from flat pieces of tin each 2¼ by 3¼
inches. The tin is folded over on the two shortest
sides of each piece before it is formed into a cylindrical
shape, the folded sides of the tin forming each
end of the cylinders.</p>

<p>The connecting rods are made of two strips of
tin, each ¾ by 6¼ inches. Both sides of the strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
are folded in, making a triple thickness of tin and
a connecting rod about ⁵⁄₁₆ inch wide and 6¼
inches long.</p>

<p>A disk of tin is soldered to one end of each connecting
rod. These disks should be somewhat
smaller than the diameter of the cylinders so that they
may slide easily back and forth inside the cylinders.</p>

<p>The connecting rods have to be bent at the two
angles shown in <a href="#fig89">Fig. 89</a> so that each rod may be
in line with the cylinder and with the driving wheel.</p>

<p><b>The Smokestack, Steam Dome and Whistle,
Sand Box and Headlight.</b>—The smokestack is rolled
up from a piece of tin 2¾ by 2⅞ inches. This piece
of tin is cut from the side of a can so as to leave the
rolled rim at the top for the rim of the stack.</p>

<p>The steam dome is made of the top part of a
tooth powder can with the distributer top left on.
This top is left open to form a whistle. That part
of the tooth powder can which rests against the
boiler must be fitted very carefully so as to conform
to the curve of the boiler.</p>

<p>The sand box may be made from a bottle cap
and the headlight may be made from another bottle
cap as shown in the drawing.</p>

<p><b>Cars.</b>—A coal tender for the locomotive may be
made from a small square box mounted on a frame
or platform similar to the locomotive, only smaller.
The car wheels may be made from the small evaporated
milk cans or from any small cans obtainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>A freight car may be made from a long square
box in a manner similar to the coal tender. Passenger
cars may be made from long rectangular cans
and the windows and doors may be cut or painted
on the sides or ends. Be sure to place folded strips
of tin over any raw edges left when cutting out
windows and doors.</p>

<p><b>A Passenger Car and Some Others.</b>—A passenger
car may be made from an olive or cooking oil can;
that is, about half of one of the larger cans cut
lengthwise. Select a can so that when it is cut
lengthwise to dimension it will be in proportion to
the locomotive which is to be used with it. No
dimensions are given in the drawings as these cans
vary in size, but it is not difficult to find a suitable
rectangular can for a passenger car.</p>

<p>When the can is cut open, draw two parallel
lines along the sides for window openings. Do not
try to cut each window separately, but cut one long
opening for all the windows, bind the cut edges with
folded strips and then solder folded pieces across
the window openings at intervals for divisions between
the windows.</p>

<p>Cut a door in each end of the car and bind the
edges with folded tin. The projecting hoods over
the door at each end of the car roof may be made of
part of the sides and bottom of a square can or from
that part of the olive or cooking oil can that is cut
away in making the body of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>A flat piece of tin may be used for the bottom of
the car, this piece being formed in exactly the same
way that the frame of the auto truck is formed. It
is made long enough to allow for a platform at each
end of the car, and the car body is soldered
securely to it.</p>

<p>Car wheels may be made from very small cans as
any other tin can wheels are made. Two bottle caps
may be soldered together for a wheel or several flat
disks of tin may be cut and soldered together at the
edges to form a wheel. The tin washers used with
roofing nails make an excellent wheel when two are
soldered together, back to back. Never try to use a
single can lid, bottle cap or tin disk for a wheel that
is to bear any weight. Any of these are too weak to
stand up alone. The wheels are mounted in the
manner shown in the drawings of the passenger car.</p>

<p>Other cars may be made from cans as shown in
<a href="#fig90">Fig. 90</a>, the construction being so simple as to need
no further description. These cars may be made as
simple or as elaborate as the skill of the maker permits.</p>

<p>WATER WHEELS AND SANDMILLS—A SIMPLE STEAM
TURBINE AND BOILER—A WINDMILL AND TOWER—AEROPLANE
WEATHERVANE</p>

</div>

<p>Water wheels and sandmills may be made
from bottle caps and can lids. Two push-in or
friction-top can lids are soldered together to form
a flanged wheel and bottle caps are soldered between
the flanges, at equal intervals, for the buckets. The
general construction is shown in <a href="#fig91">Fig. 91</a>. A nozzle
may be formed from a piece of tin and soldered to
the standard so that a hose may be connected with
it and to faucet, or, the water wheel may be set in a
sink under a faucet or placed in a stream of running
water.</p>

<p>A funnel or sand hopper may be made of tin and
soldered to a standard which holds the bucket wheel.
Fine dry sand placed in the hopper will run through
the hole in the bottom and cause the bucket wheel
to revolve.</p>

<p><b>A Simple Steam Turbine and Boiler.</b>—A very
simple and amusing steam turbine that runs with
steam generated in a tin-can boiler may be made
from tin cans. Select a well-soldered can with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tight-fitting lid, such as a molasses or syrup can
with a friction-top lid. The lid will have to be
soldered in place to make it steam tight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig91">
<img src="images/figure91.jpg" width="400" height="575" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Punch a hole about ¼ inch in diameter near one
side of the lid for a filler hole. See that this hole is
perfectly round so that a cork may be fitted in to
make it steam tight.</p>

<p>The vane wheel should be about 3 inches in
diameter and very carefully made. See that the axle
is soldered exactly in the center of the wheel. The
vanes should be small and numerous and each one
exactly the same size. The method of construction
is shown on <a href="#Page_83">page 183</a> (full page drawing).
A 3-inch circle is carefully laid out on a flat piece
of tin and then another circle is laid off inside
the first one about ¾ inch in. The outer circle is
then divided up into 36 equal parts. Draw straight
lines from each dividing dot at the edge to the
center of the wheel. Bore a small hole exactly
where each line crosses the inner circle. Cut down
each dividing line to each hole. Use the pliers to turn
each vane at right angles to the face of the wheel.</p>

<p>The steam nozzle should be very small. A triangular
piece of tin may be formed around a fine
wire nail or pin. The opening in the nozzle should
be about ⅟₃₂ inch in diameter. The nozzle should
be well soldered together and then soldered to the
boiler, over a hole of a suitable size to allow the
steam to flow from the boiler into the nozzle. Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sure not to solder up the tube so that the steam may
not escape. A piece of broom straw may be placed
in the nozzle when soldering it together, and it may
be left in when the nozzle is soldered to the boiler.
The straw should extend into the boiler and may be
withdrawn when the soldering operations are completed.
Do not use wire inside the nozzle to prevent
it filling with solder as the solder will stick to it
and prevent its being withdrawn.</p>

<p>Use care in placing the nozzle in position under
the vane wheel so that the steam will strike the
vanes squarely when it escapes. Set the end of the
nozzle as close to the vanes as possible, but so that it
does not strike the vanes when the wheel revolves.</p>

<p>These turbines run at very high speed when carefully
made. Do not use too much heat under the
boiler, as too great pressure may explode it with
disastrous results. If the boiler is set over a gas
flame, take care not to allow the flame to flare out
around the boiler and creep up the sides, as it may
then melt off the top of the boiler even when there
is considerable water in it. A moderate flame will
cause enough pressure to be generated in the boiler
to make the vane wheel revolve rapidly. If care is
used in fitting the cork in the filler hole, it may be
made steam tight by pushing it into the filler hole
with a light pressure so that if too much pressure is
generated in the boiler the cork will blow out.</p>

<p>A pinion from a small clock works may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
soldered to the vane wheel shaft and meshed in
with a large gear which is set on a shaft soldered
to the supporting upright at one side of the wheel.
A small pulley may be made of wood or metal and
fastened to the large gear. This arrangement of
gears will give a reduced speed and a string belt
may be run from the pulley to some light running
toy machine. The pinion and gear fastened to the
turbine should run very easily.</p>

<p>An alcohol heating lamp may be made for the
turbine boiler by soldering a wick tube and a vent
tube to a shoe paste or salve box.</p>

<p>The wick tube should be made from a strip of
tin rolled up into a cylindrical shape. It should be
about ½ inch in diameter and 1½ inches in length
when soldered together. The wick tube should extend
about 1 inch above the top of the lamp and it
should be soldered firmly in a hole cut in the top of
the lamp to receive it.</p>

<p>A small tube about ¼ inch in diameter and 3
inches long is soldered together. This tube should
be soldered over a hole near the side of the lamp at
the top and soldered on at an angle as shown in
<a href="#fig91">Fig. 91</a>. It serves as a vent, allowing the alcohol
gas generated within the top of the lamp to escape
and it also serves as a handle. An alcohol lamp
fitted with a vent tube of this description will not
boil over and catch fire as so many of the small
alcohol lamps provided with toy steam engines are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
sure to do. Vent tubes soldered to these lamps in
such a manner as to conduct the gas away from the
flame will provide against accidents of this sort.</p>

<p>A filler hole should be placed in the top of the
lamp as far away from the wick tube as possible.
A common cork may be used as a stopper. A small
funnel may be easily made from some pieces of
scrap tin and used for filling the boiler and the lamp.</p>

<p><b>A Windmill and Tower.</b>—A windmill and tower
that will look very realistic when completed may be
made from tin cans. The vane wheel is composed of
twelve blades set in two can lids. The vanes are cut
from a flat piece of tin, care being taken to make
each one exactly the same size. A large can lid is
used for the outer vane support and the central part
of this lid is cut away. Twelve cuts are made around
the edge of the can lid at equal distances and the
vanes soldered in these cuts.</p>

<p>A small can lid is used for the center of the
wheel and the ends of the vanes soldered to it.</p>

<p>The tower is made of strips of folded tin and
the tank from a tin can is shown in <a href="#fig92">Fig. 92</a>.</p>

<p><b>Aeroplane Weathervane.</b>—A biplane weathervane
may be made from flat strips of tin. Large
round or square cans may be opened out and the tin
taken from them used to make the aeroplane
weathervane. When this weathervane is mounted
on a suitable spike on which it may turn about freely
in the wind, the propeller will revolve rapidly when
the wind blows.</p>

<p>The construction of the aeroplane is quite simple
and the principal dimensions are given in <a href="#fig93">Fig. 93</a>.
The construction is very well shown in <a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII</a>.
If the foregoing problems have been satisfactorily
worked out there will be no difficulty in constructing
the aeroplane from the dimensions given.</p>

<p>The two wings are made from two pieces of tin
of the required size with the edges folded over.</p>

<p>The body of fuselage is made of a long triangular
piece of tin folded up on each side so as to form
a sort of long tapering box. A cover is made for
this box and divided into two parts so as to leave a
cockpit opening.</p>

<p>The struts or wing supports are made from narrow
strips of tin that are folded almost together for
strength. The small guy wires had best be made
from copper wire of small diameter. If it is difficult
to get small copper wire, it may be possible to get
two or three feet of insulated copper wire used for
electrical purposes. Such wire is employed to wind
small magnets used on electric bells. The insulation
easily burns off. Copper wire solders very easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="fig93">
<img src="images/figure93.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The rudder and tail planes are made from flat
pieces of tin. A straight piece of wire is used for
the propeller shaft. A tube is made of tin and used
as a bearing for the shaft. The propeller shaft
should fit very loosely in the tube. The bearing tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
is soldered firmly to the body of the aeroplane as
shown in <a href="#fig93">Fig. 93</a>. When completely assembled,
except for the propeller and its shaft, the propeller
is soldered to one end of the shaft. Care should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
taken to mount the propeller blade in such a way
that the shaft is exactly in the center, so that one
side of the propeller is not heavier than the other.
The shaft is pushed through the bearing tube and
should project about ¼ inch beyond it. A strip of
tin is wound around this projecting end of the shaft
and soldered to it in such a manner that the shaft is
free to turn in the tube.</p>

<p>When the plane is completely assembled try it to
find the point at which it balances when rested on
the finger under the fuselage. A hole should be
punched at this point large enough to admit the iron
rod or piece of heavy wire that is to be used for the
spike on which to mount the weathervane. A second
hole is punched directly above the first one; this
hole is considerably smaller than the hole beneath it.
The top of the iron spike that supports the aeroplane
weathervane is filed down to a smaller diameter
so that when the spike is pushed through the
larger hole the smaller or filed part of the spike will
go through the hole in the upper part of the fuselage.
The weathervane will then rest on the shoulder
formed on the spike as shown in the illustration. A
block of wood may be nailed to the roof peak of the
house or barn and a hole bored into it the size of
the supporting spike, and the spike may be pushed
into this and the aeroplane weathervane mounted
on the spike. It should be well painted in bright
colors and if well made will prove a very pleasing toy.</p>

forms and soldered together. As may be seen
by studying them, the shafts are made from ordinary

<p>The spout is made of a separate piece of tin of a
triangular shape. This piece of tin is formed into
shape and is then riveted to the coffee pot over the
strainer holes. After it is held in place by the rivets
it is tightly soldered so that it will not leak. The

are punched in the box lid and the tin pipe or nipple
is soldered in a hole made for it in the bottom
of the box.</p>

<p>A wire hook is provided at the rim of the pail
to hold the spray nozzle in place when it is not
desired to have the water run out of it.</p>

<p>It will be found convenient to have a double
pulley and rope rigged to hoist the pail to a convenient
height after filling.</p>

<p><b>The Match Box.</b>—The match box is made of two
cigarette boxes, one for good matches and the
other for burned matches. These boxes are of ample
size to hold the paper drawer of a large box of
parlor matches.</p>

<p>The hinged top is left on the box that is to hold
the unburned matches. This box is soldered to two
supporting brackets in such a manner that it is held
away from the piece of tin forming the back for
the two boxes and so that the lid of the upper box
may be raised. The lower box is simply soldered to
the back piece. Three folded strips of tin are soldered
to the front of this second box to form a holder
for a strip of sand paper to strike the matches on.</p>

<p>REMOVING SURPLUS SOLDER WITH SCRAPERS—MAKING
A HOE SCRAPER—PLUMBERS’ AND ROOFERS’
SCRAPERS—SCRAPING AND FILING—BOILING THE
TOYS IN A LYE BATH—VENT HOLES</p>

</div>

<p>It frequently happens that more solder is applied
to the joints than is needed to cement the work
together or that the solder is left in a rather rough
or lumpy state due to the inexperience of the worker.</p>

<p>The beginner should be in no wise discouraged if
this is so, for there is a certain knack in soldering
neatly and this is only acquired by experience and
by closely observing the simple rules governing
the operation.</p>

<p>The beginner should be sure that enough solder
is applied to hold the work firmly together. The
surplus solder may be scraped away by using a
simple scraper shaped like a hoe. An old knife is
also useful for cutting away lumps of solder. An
old file or rasp which has very coarse teeth may be
used to file away solder. A finely cut file should
never be used to file solder as the fine teeth will
clog up with solder and the file be rendered useless
for any further work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Making a Hoe Scraper.</b>—A hoe scraper may be
made from a cheap screw driver, such as those obtainable
from the 5-and-10 cent stores. The end of
the screw driver that is applied to the screw is heated
red hot (a dull red). It is then placed quickly between
the jaws of a vise so that the jaws grasp it
about ½ inch from the end and before the steel has
time to cool, it is bent over like a hoe, see <a href="#fig97">Fig. 97</a>.</p>

<p>Use a flat fine-toothed file to file the cutting edges
to about the angle shown in the enlarged drawing of
the working end of the hoe scraper.</p>

<p>When the tool is filed into shape, heat the end
again to a dull red and plunge it quickly in a pail of
water several times until it is entirely cold. The
tool is then ready for use.</p>

<p>The hoe scraper is a very simple tool to use. The
cutting edge is simply dragged with slight pressure
over the solder to be removed, and will remove a
little solder each time it is dragged over it. This
tool may be sharpened easily with a smooth file or
on a grindstone when it becomes dull.</p>

<p>Do not try to remove too much solder at once
and do not take away too much solder from the
joint as you will weaken it. Simply smooth up the
solder so that it will look well when painted over.</p>

<p><b>Plumbers’ and Roofers’ Scrapers.</b>—Two very
handy scrapers may be purchased from a dealer in
tinners’ tools. One of them is called a Plumbers’
Scraper and is shown in <a href="#fig97">Fig. 97</a>. The other is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a Roofing Scraper and is shown in <a href="#fig97">Fig. 97</a>. Either
of these tools will prove very useful for removing
solder.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Boiling the Toys in a Lye Bath.</b>—When the toys
are completely assembled and before they are
painted they should be thoroughly boiled up in a lye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
bath to remove all grease, soldering paste or acid,
paper or painted labels, etc.</p>

<p>The lye bath is made by adding two heaping
tablespoonfuls of lye or washing soda to the gallon
of boiling water. Lye or washing soda may be purchased
at any grocery store.</p>

<p>The lye solution should be mixed up in an old
wash boiler or a large can or pail, placed over a hot
fire and kept boiling gently during such time as the
toys are immersed in the lye bath. Enough lye solution
should be made up so that at least half of the
article to be cleaned will be covered with it. The toy
is left in the bath until that part of it which is covered
with the solution is clean. It is then removed
from the bath, rinsed, and then that part of the toy
that remains to be cleaned is placed in the solution.
The whole toy should be thoroughly rinsed with
warm water when it is finally removed from the lye
bath. Make sure that it is thoroughly dry and also
that any water or lye solution that may have gotten
inside any partially sealed-up parts of the toy is
removed before attempting to paint it.</p>

<p>Take care not to place the hands in the lye solution,
hot or cold, as it is very injurious to the skin.
Any lye solution accidently spilled on cloth will eat
holes in it unless washed out with plenty of water
immediately. The work should be handled with
wire hooks when lifting it out of the lye bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>A fresh lye bath should be made up occasionally
as it loses its cleansing power in proportion to the
work boiled up in it. Lye may be added to a bath
already made up if this bath has not accumulated
too much dirt.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;" id="fig98">
<img src="images/figure98.jpg" width="275" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Vent Holes.</b>—If a can is used to represent a
boiler or is made up into a drum-like structure, such
as a wheel, and is not soldered up air tight, it is apt
to fill up with the hot lye solution when placed in it.
Unless there are two air holes or vents provided in
such a boiler or wheel, the lye or water will not all
run out when it is removed from the bath, but it
will ooze out from time to time perhaps after the toy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
has been painted for some time. The lye thus liberated
will ruin all paint with which it comes in contact.</p>

<p>At least two vent holes should be punched or
bored in all drum-like structures employed about
the toys, one hole at the top to admit air and another
hole at the bottom to allow the water or lye solution
to escape. These vent holes are particularly necessary
in wheels that are made from cans, see <a href="#fig98">Fig. 98</a>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smcap">Notes on Painting the Toys</span></h2>

<p>The tin toys should be painted with a good grade
of enamel paint. Enamel paints have varnish mixed
with them and dry hard and glossy and form a very
durable and attractive finish for the toys.</p>

<p>There are several popular brands of these enamel
paints on the market and almost any of them will
give good results if properly applied.</p>

<p>Several colors should be purchased to start with,
black, white, cherry red, chrome yellow, prussian or
royal blue. With this assortment of colors, it is
possible to get a variety of shades by mixing. A can
of vermilion and a can of khaki-colored enamel
paint, as well as small cans of gold and silver and
bronze paint, will prove very handy additions to the
above collection of colors. The vermilion, gold
and silver paints are used to paint certain details of
the toys that need to be emphasized.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep all the cans of paint tightly covered
when not in use, so that the paint will not dry
up and become thick and gummy from contact with
the air.</p>

<p>Several paint brushes should be purchased at the
paint dealers, the largest brush should be of soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
hair about ½ inch wide, and the smallest brush a
tiny pointed one for detail and line work. Always
keep these brushes covered with turpentine after
using them or wash them out immediately after
by scrubbing them on a cake of soap with plenty
of warm water.</p>

<p>Cut several small cans down to tray size and use
them for mixing the paint.</p>

<p>Always stir up a can of paint before using it.
Use a small stick for stirring and keep at it until the
paint is thoroughly mixed. Enamel paints may be
thinned with turpentine and a bottle of this should
be kept on hand.</p>

<p>Do not use your paint too thick. It should be of
such a consistency as to drip slowly from the brush
before the brush is wiped against the side of the can
to remove the surplus paint upon commencing
the work.</p>

<p>Be sure to mix up enough paint to cover the
entire surface to be painted if using mixed colors,
as it is very difficult to mix a second batch of the
same shade of color.</p>

<p>Think how you are going to apply your paint
before starting. Try to plan your painting so
that you will not have to work over a painted surface
a second time until that surface is thoroughly
dry. The paint should be applied smoothly with
a brush. Just enough paint should be held in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
brush so that it flows onto the tin without streaks of
the tin showing through the paint.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you should start at the top of
a piece of work and paint down. Each fresh brush
stroke should overlap the one above it and mop up
any surplus paint of the former brush strokes.</p>

<p>Paint the intricate parts first and then the plain
surfaces. For instance, when painting the aeroplane
weathervane, use a small brush and paint the struts
first, then paint around the bases and tops of the
struts on the surface of the planes. Change the
small brush for a larger one and flow more paint
over the surface of the planes, gathering up the paint
around the ends of the struts as you paint along.</p>

<p>When painting a large model, such as an army
truck, and not being quite sure of the quantity of
paint needed, mix up enough paint to paint all the
parts of the model that show the most and leave such
parts as the bottom of the frame and the inside of
the body until last. If you have to mix up more
paint for these last parts it will not matter if it is
not exactly the same shade.</p>

<p>If you have not had very much experience in
mixing and combining colors, it is generally better
to use the different tints just as they come from the
cans, without trying to mix them.</p>

<p>Do not use too many colors on one toy, but try
to get a pleasing effect with two or three colors that
look well together. For instance, a truck may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
painted an olive green or khaki color over its entire
surface, excepting the front of the radiator which
should be painted with silver paint.</p>

<p>When the first coat of paint is thoroughly dry,
lines of black may be painted about the body and
various edges emphasized with black. The hubs of
the wheels, the lamps, the rim of the steering wheel,
and the filler cap on the radiator may all be painted
black with good effect. The part of the wheels
which is supposed to represent the tires should be
painted a dark gray. (Gray may be made by mixing
black and white together.)</p>

<p>Study the large trucks seen about the streets for
inspiration. These large trucks are nearly always
very simply and attractively painted.</p>

<p>Real locomotives are painted black at present,
but a small toy locomotive looks much better if the
wheels are painted red (vermilion). A red band
may be painted about the top of the smokestack
and the tin strips framing the cab windows should
be painted red, as may the number of the engine, etc.</p>

<p>The whistle should be painted with gold paint
and also the inside of the headlight, and broad lines
may be painted about the boiler with gold to represent
the straps seen about locomotive boilers.</p>

<p>Paint the tires of the engine wheels with silver
paint. The driving rods may be painted either
black or silver.</p>

<p>A toy locomotive thus painted will prove far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
more attractive to a child than if it is painted a plain
black like a real locomotive.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the toys should be painted
one dominating color of an attractive tint and relieved
or brightened with lines and certain details
painted with a bright or contrasting color.</p>

<p>Always allow one coat of paint to dry thoroughly
before painting on it again.</p>

<p>Tin toys may be baked in an oven when they are
freshly painted. The baking dries the enamel paint
very quickly and tends to make the paint dry very
hard and smooth. The baking oven of a coal or gas
range will do very well for the baking, but be very
sure that the oven is not too hot, as a hot oven will
cause the solder to melt and the toys to fall apart.
It is better to leave the oven door opened slightly
when baking the painted toys over a slow fire.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to bake the toys after painting
as they may be simply left to dry in the air.</p>

<p>Always paint slowly and carefully. Toys that
are attractively painted to match good construction
are much more satisfactory than a well-made toy
poorly painted.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
